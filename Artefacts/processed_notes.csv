Characteristics of Living Organisms 
• Living organisms are classified into 5 groups: animals, plants, fungi, prokaryotes (bacteria) and 
protoctists 
• There are 7 main characteristics carried out by all organisms 
Nutrition 
• Obtaining of food to provide energy and substances needed for growth and repair 
• Plants: involves photosynthesis and taking up of mineral ions from soil (autotrophs) 
• Animals: Eat plants to gain energy and nutrients (ingestion) which is used for growth and repair 
(heterotrophs) 
Respiration 
• Involves the chemical reactions that release energy in the cells 
• Glucose + oxygen  
 
carbon dioxide + water + energy 
• Energy is used for growth and repair 
Movement 
• Organisms move a part or parts of themselves in order to change their position or place. 
• Plants move slowly whilst growing, and leaves change position to absorb more light 
• Animals move part of whole body to obtain food or flee predators 
Excretion 
• The removal of waste products formed during metabolism 
• Plants store their waste in leaves, which subsequently fall off 
• Animals breathe out Carbon dioxide and produce urine  
Sensitivity 
• Organisms sense stimuli and respond to them 
• Plants move their leaves according to the position of the sun, or they open and close their 
flowers 
• Animals have sensory glands and organs which detect light, sound pressure, etc. 
Growth 
• Permanent increase in size and dry mass 
• Increase in cell number, cell size or both 
• Plants grow throughout their life, animals stop at a certain size 
Reproduction 
• A process which results in the formation of new individuals 
• Asexual reproduction is whereby one parent creates the offspring, there is no genetic variation, 
and the individual is genetically identical to the parent 

• Sexual reproduction is whereby two parents gametes’ fuse to create a new individual who carries 
a mixed set of genes 
Classification 
• Kingdom 
• Phylum/Division 
• Class 
• Order  
• Family 
• Genus  
• Species 
Importance of classification 
• Classification is the sorting out of living organisms into groups 
• Scientists look at the differences and the similarities to then classify organisms when it comes to 
their  morphology (outward appearance) and their anatomy (inward structure) 
Binomial system of classification 
• The binomial system consists of two names (genus and species/trivial) 
• Worldwide system used by scientists 
• Used to avoid confusion as many animals have more than one name 
Genus 
• The genus refers to a group of similar individuals that are closely related but do not interbreed 
with each other 
• The genus is always written with a capital letter 
• The name is always written in italics or underlined 
Species/trivial 
• A very similar group of individuals that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring 
• Written in small letters 
• Never used on its own 
Modern Classification 
• DNA sequencing and studying the sequencing of amino acids in proteins is more accurate than 
just observations 
• If the sequences are very similar, they are placed in the same genus/species

biology,Unit 10 Diseases and Immunity,"Diseases and Immunity 
Disease 
• Pathogens are organisms that cause diseases (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protoctists and worms) 
• Diseases caused by these pathogens are called transmissible diseases ad they can be 
passed/transmitted from one person to another. They are also called infectious diseases 
Method of 
transmission 
Description 
Examples of diseases 
Through air 
Pathogens in tiny droplets of liquid from the airways and 
lungs of infected people 
Influenza, tuberculosis, 
common cold 
Contaminated food 
and drink 
People preparing food who do not wash their hands; 
foods that are not cooked properly; human faeces 
contaminating water supplies; flies transfer pathogens 
on their bodies 
Cholera, typhoid 
Direct contact 
Uninfected people touch infected people, or items, that 
infected people have used 
Athlete’s foot 
Insect vectors 
Insects e.g. mosquitoes feed on the blood of an infected 
person and then feed on an uninfected person 
Malaria, dengue fever 
Body fluids 
Blood from an infected person enters the blood of an 
uninfected person, e.g. an unsterilized needle shared 
between drug users 
HIV/AIDs, hepatitis  
Person  activity  
Pathogens pass from uninfected person to sexual 
partner in blood, semen or vaginal fluid 
HIV/AIDs, nonspecific 
uteritis (NSU), chlamydia  
 
Defences against diseases 
1. The first line of defence prevents pathogens entering the body 
2. The second line destroys any pathogens that beak through the first line of defence 
3. The third line produces antibodies that defend us against specific pathogens  
Barriers to infection 
Mechanical barriers 
• The dead outer layers of the skin form a barrier to entry  
• The hairs in the nose trap large particles that are inhaled 
Chemical barriers 
• The stomach makes hydrochloric acid that kills pathogens in food 
• Cells that line the airways make mucus that traps dust particles and microorganisms. The mucus 
is moved away from the lungs and up in the throat by cilia. The mucus is swallowed and any 
pathogens are destroyed by stomach acid  
If any pathogens get through these barriers and enter the blood, then there is a second line of defence. 
Blood defences 
• White blood cells form a line of defence against pathogens 
• Phagocytes engulf bacteria and viruses into vacuoles where they are digested and destroyed 
(phagocytosis) 

• Lymphocytes produce antibodies  
• When activated- antibodies have a variety of effects on pathogens  
• Such as stopping pathogens from moving around the body and it easier for phagocytes to engulf 
them 
• Vaccination is a way to make lymphocytes produce antibodies and give them long term 
protection against certain diseases 
Defence against disease 
• All pathogens have chemical proteins on their surface called antigens 
• When you catch a disease lymphocytes respond by making antibodies, which can lock onto the 
surface of the pathogens 
There are several ways in which antibodies attack pathogens: 
i. 
They cause bacteria to stick together in a group, making it easier for phagocytes to find and 
engulf them 
ii. 
Some bacteria have flagellum, antibodies can attach to flagella and stop them from moving  
iii. 
Bacteria such as diphtheria and tetanus can release toxins into the blood, antitoxins ae a special 
group of antibodies which combine with toxins and neutralise them making them harmless 
iv. 
Some antibodies kill bacteria directly by punching holes through cell walls. This weakens cell 
walls so water enters by osmosis causing the cells to burst 
Immune response 
• Each type of pathogen has its own antigens which have a specific shape. The antibodies are 
made against each type of antigen that have a shape that fits around the antigen. The antibody 
has a complimentary shape to the antigen  
• When contracting an infection you will be ill and have a variety of symptoms, you will begin to 
feel better in a week or two and will be back to your normal healthy self 
• If the virus attacks the system for the second time, you will not have the same symptoms or be ill. 
Lymphocytes are responsible for this and are activated during immune response  
• You are born with a large number of different types of lymphocytes. These cells are specific to 
different antigens on the surface of different pathogens. When a pathogen invades, some 
lymphocytes respond and invade to make more cells of the same type 
• Many of these lymphocytes become bigger and fill many ribosomes attached to a network of 
endoplasmic reticulum. The antibodies are secreted into the blood and lymph and distributed 
around the body. The antibodies lock on to the specific antigens on pathogens that have invaded 
the body  
• Other lymphocytes are activated to patrol around the body looking for infected cells. When they 
find an infected cell they destroy it and stop it from producing more pathogens 
• The reason HIV is such a serious infection is that it destroys the body’s lymphocytes that are 
responsible for much of our defines against infectious disease 
• The response to the first infection is slow  
• The response to the second attack by the same pathogen is faster 
• This process of defence against pathogens by antibody production is known as active immunity  
• Becoming immune after catching a transmissible disease and being ill is a natural way to gain 
active immunity  

• During immune response, many lymphocytes are produced- many develop into anti body 
producing cells but some do not 
• They remain in blood and lymph circulating around the body  
• These are memory cells which respond whenever there is another invasion by the same 
pathogen with the same antigens 
• During each immune response to specific pathogens, more and more lymphocytes are produced 
to stay in the body  
• Therefore when the pathogen invades the body there will be far more lymphocytes with the 
ability to produce the right antibodies 
• The response to any subsequent infection is therefore much faster and much greater  
Vaccination  
• It is possible to promote active immunity without being ill  
• This is done by injecting a vaccine that contains live pathogens, dead pathogens or antigens 
taken from the surface of proteins. 
• Each vaccine stimulates immunity to a specific type of disease e.g. measles, mumps, rubella 
• In some cases, the vaccine provides protection against a specific strain of that disease, in the 
cases if influenza diseases 
• Vaccination is an artificial way to gain active immunity 
Aspects of immunity  
Passive immunity  
•  If protection is required in a hurry, antibodies may be given by injection. This provides only 
temporary immunity, but it should be sufficient to give protection. Immunity gained this way is 
passive immunity  
• Antibodies pass across the placenta and are present in the break milk, so giving a baby protection 
against diseases which his/her mother will have immunity against 
• This is also temporary as the baby’s body treats the mother’s antibodies as foreign and destroys 
them  
• The immunity is gained without exposure to antigens so it is safer than active immunity 
• Passive immunity is used in cases where people are at risk of  tetanus entering the body through 
open wounds 
• Health workers inject a vaccine that neutralise toxins produced by the bacteria which can cause 
muscle paralysis  
• Venom from snakes, scorpions, spiders and other dangerous animals act far too quickly for active 
immunity to be of any use 
• People who have been bitten by venomous animals need anti venom extremely quickly  
• Anti-venom contains antibodies to the molecules in the venom 
• Specialist companies collect venom from these animals and inject them in small quantities to horse 
and sheep 
• This prompts an immune response and the antibodies are collected from the blood, processed and 
made available to hospitals in areas where people are at risk of being bitten by venomous animals 
• No memory cells are produced in passive immunity, so this type of immunity is short term but 
instantaneous  
• As soon as the antibodies enter the body they are available to be used 

• There is no wait between the arrival of the antigens and the production of the antibodies as there is 
in active immunity 
Malfunction of the immune system  
• Sometimes the immune system does not work perfectly 
• When this happens it detects our own antibodies as something foreign and this prompts an 
immune response 
• As a result the immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue by mistake  
• Malfunctions of the immune system cause a variety of diseases collectively known as 
autoimmune diseases  
• Examples are: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes  
Type 1 diabetes  
• This type of diabetes is caused when the immune system attacks and destroys the cells of the 
pancreas that make insulin 
• This usually happens rapidly usually before the age of 20 
• Insulin helps to control the concentration of glucose in the blood 
• It is made in response to an increase in the glucose concentration in the blood usually while a 
meal is being absorbed 
• Insulin stimulates the liver and muscles to store glucose as glycogen  
• This means that glucose is not stored for times when it will be needed by cells to release energy 
in respiration 
The symptoms of Type 1 diabetes are: 
i. 
Weight loss- cells use protein and fat instead of glucose as sources of energy  
ii. 
Thirst- this is due to the increased concentration of glucose in the blood that lowers its water 
potential  
iii. 
Tiredness due to lack of glycogen that can be converted to glucose to provide energy between 
meals  
One indicator of diabetes is the presence of glucose in urine  
People with diabetes are treated with regular injections of insulin. The drug is manufactured using 
techniques of genetic engineering and many different types are available so that diabetics can control 
their blood glucose concentration efficiently  
Controlling the spread of disease 
Preventing infection  
Personal hygiene 
• People of all ages should wash their hands after urinating or defecating and also before 
handling or eating food 
• Hair should be washed with shampoo to prevent dandruff and head lice 
• Everyone should wash themselves frequently, especially in hot weather  
• Brushing teeth regularly, and flossing to prevent dental cavities 
• Cuts and bruises washed with an antiseptic and plasters placed on open wounds  

Hygienic Food Preparation  
• Food should be covered to keep flies away 
• Kitchen surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectants to kill bacteria 
• Food should be cooked thoroughly to make sure any bacteria (e.g. salmonella) are killed 
• Cooked food should be separated from raw food 
• Water used for cooking/drinking should be boiled or sterilised by adding water purification 
tablets if it comes from sources that might be contaminated  
Proper Waste Disposal  
• Household waste should be placed in covered bins and collected at regular intervals 
• Collected rubbish should be disposed of correctly, recycled, incinerated or buried in properly 
regulated landfill sites 
• If not regulated carefully will attract rats and flies who are diseases carriers 
• Effluent from rubbish tips may contain harmful chemicals that cause pollution  
Sewage Treatment  
• Toilet water is a serious health hazard if not disposed properly 
• Human wastes are broken down by microorganisms in sewage treatment works 
• The pathogens that cause typhoid and cholera are transmitted through faeces and transmit to 
people who drink water or eat food contaminated by raw sewage  
• Thorough sewage treatment breaks down the transmission of typhoid and cholera so these 
diseases are unknown in countries with proper sanitation  
The role of vaccination 
• Vaccination programs are an important part of health  
• Infants and children are vaccinated against diseases that used to be common and responsible 
for many deaths  
• Many of these diseases are now very rare in many parts of the world 
• During eradication programmes vaccination is used in two ways: 
• Mass vaccination schemes attempt to give active immunity to everyone  
• Some do not respond to vaccines but they can be protected because the chances of them coming 
into contact with the disease are small and most people around them have immunity and will not 
transmit the disease 
• Careful surveillance by health officials identify people who have infectious diseases and the 
spread of the disease is limited or stopped by vaccinating all people who have come into contact 
with infected people  
• For some diseases there are no cure, such as HIV, Ebola and dengue fever

biology,Unit 11 Gas Exchange in Humans,"Gas Exchange in Humans 
The Gas Exchange System 
Structure 
• 
The lungs are spongy organs found inside the chest (thorax) and are surrounded and protected by the 
sternum (breastbone). 
• 
The diaphragm is a sheet of fibrous tissue and muscle that separates the thorax from the abdomen 
• 
The movement of the diaphragm changes the volume of the lungs to move air when you breathe in and out 
• 
The intercostal muscles between the ribs move the ribs during breathing, especially during deep 
breathing  
• 
Air enters the nose or mouth and passes through the throat to the larynx (voice-box).  
• 
It then enters the trachea (windpipe), which connects the throat to the lundgs 
• 
It branches to form two bronchi which enter each kung 
• 
These continue to divide to form many bronchioles, which end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 
• 
It is here that gas exchange takes place 
• 
The tubes through which air moves are often called airways 
• 
The larynx contains vocal chords, when air passes over these you make sounds 
• 
You cannot breather and swallow at the same time, this is because as you swallow a flap called the 
epiglottis moves to cover the opening of the larynx, this stops food from going down your trachea 
• 
The trachea is kept open by C shaped rings of cartilage. The arms of the cartilage are joined by muscles 
at the back of the trachea 
• 
The cartilage prevents the trachea from collapsing as you breathe in when the air pressure decreases 
Composition of air 
Gas Exchange Surfaces 
• 
Have a very large surface area for diffusion of gases 
• 
Moist surfaces so that gases can dissolve before diffusion 
• 
A thin surface 9only one cell thick in each alveolus) so the 
gases do not have to diffuse very far 
• 
A good supply so that lots of carbon dioxide is removed 
quickly and lots of oxygen is supplied quickly, maintaining 
concentration gradients 
• 
Ventilation of the lungs ensures that the air in the air 
passages is changed; this helps maintain the gas concentration 
gradients between air in the alveoli and that in the blood 
Gas exchange at the alveolus  
• 
Oxygen molecules from the alveolus diffuse into the red blood cells and combine with haemoglobin. The 
red blood cells can then transport oxygen to the body tissues 
• 
There is a lot of carbon dioxide in the capillary, carried from respiring tissues to the blood plasma. It 
diffuses in the opposite direction, through the capillary wall acoss the alveolar wall into the space insid 
the alveolus, from here it is breathed out 
• 
Alveoli are surrounded by elastic tissue. This stretches whilst breathing and recoils when breathing out 
to helps remove air from the lungs 
• 
The air we breathe out is saturated with water vapour that has evaporated from the moist walls of the 
alveoli

Breathing  
• 
Diaphragm and ribcage movements create changes in overall chest volume 
• 
This change in volume then causes a pressure change in the chest cavity  
Inspiration  
Expiration  
External intercostal muscles contract, internal 
intercostal muscles relax, ribs move upwards and 
outwards  
Internal intercostal muscles contract and external 
relaxes, ribs move downwards and inwards 
At the same time: muscle in diaphragm contracts 
and flattens 
Muscles in diaphragm relaxes, bulges outwards 
(organs press up from below) 
This increases the volume inside the thorax: 
decrease in overall pressure 
This decreases the volume inside the thorax, so 
therefore increases the pressure 
Atmospheric pressure is greater than thoracic 
pressure so air moves into the lungs 
Air is forced out of the lungs and alveoli (elastic 
recoils) 
 
Cleaning the Air 
• 
Air is warmed and moistened when inhaled by the nose 
• 
Hairs filter the air- removing particles and some pathogens 
• 
In the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles: 
→ Goblet cells secrete mucus which traps pathogens 
→ Ciliated epithelial cells have cilia which beat to carry mucus and trapped pathogens to the throat, 
where it is swallowed 
Rate and depth of breathing  
Breathing and exercise 
• 
Normal breathing rate at rest: 12-16 breaths per minute 
• 
Rate and depth increases with exercise because: 
→ Muscles need more oxygen 
 
• 
Breathing is deeper and faster in order to get more oxygen in the blood and get rid of more carbon 
dioxide 
• 
Rapid rate of respiration in muscles continues after exercise 
• 
Pulse rate remains high after exercise as the heart is still beating fast to keep up with the oxygen demand  

Depth of Breathing  
• 
An adult can take in 5l of air on their deepest breath  
• 
The vital capacity of a person is the maximum volume of air breathed out after breathing in as much air as 
possible 
• 
At rest 0.5l of air is breathed in and out 
• 
During exercise 4.5l of air is breathed in and out  
Controlling of breathing  
• 
The medulla, the part of the brain located nearest to the spinal cord, directs the signal to the spinal chord 
to maintain breathing  
• 
Breathing is an involuntary action  
• 
During exercise carbon dioxide builds up in the blood, causing pH levels to drop (blood becomes acidic) 
• 
pH change is detected by the brain which sends impulses to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to 
contract faster, leading to an increase in rate and depth of breathing 
• 
This lowers the carbon dioxide concentration in the blood and the pH returns to normal 
• 
This is an example of homeostasis",937, The lungs are spongy organs found inside the chest (thorax) and are surrounded and protected by the  sternum (breastbone) Air enters the nose or mouth and passes through the throat to the larynx (voice-box) and the trachea (windpipe) Gas exchange takes place at the alveolus (breathing in and out) and at the lungs .

biology,Unit 12 Respiration,"Respiration  
Aerobic respiration  
• All cells need energy  
• Provided by burning glucose 
• The energy is released very gradually in a series of small, enzyme controlled reactions 
• Respiration is a number of chemical reactions that break down nutrient molecules in living cells 
to release energy  
• In aerobic respiration oxygen is used in the breakdown of glucose 
• Respiration takes place in all loving cells at all times 
• Most energy is released in the mitochondria 
• Cells that require a lot of energy have many mitochondria  
• Liver cells have high metabolism and have many mitochondria 
• The epithelial cells of the small intestine absorb glucose and other molecules by active 
transport, so have large numbers of mitochondria

Using energy  
Energy is required for; 
• Muscle contraction 
• Cell division 
• Absorption of nutrients in the gut by active transport  
• Sending impulses along nerves 
• Protein synthesis for making enzymes, some hormones and antibodies 
• Making new cell membranes and cell structures like the nucleus during growth  
• Keeping the body temperature constant, some energy is released in the form of heat 
Anaerobic respiration 
• Anaerobic respiration is the chemical reaction in cells that beak down glucose to release energy 
without using oxygen  
• During strenuous exercise, too little oxygen may reach the body muscles for aerobic respiration 
to supply all the energy the energy the muscles need 
• Muscle tissue respires anaerobically to release energy 
• Most of the enzyme catalysed reactions of aerobic respiration do not happen without oxygen 
• As a result glucose is not broken down to carbon dioxide and water but to lactic acid instead 
𝑔𝑙𝑢𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑒 →𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑+ 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 
• Cardiac muscle does not respire anaerobically as it would not release enough energy for the 
heart to beat properly 
• Some bacteria also respire anaerobically to make lactic acid (often used to make yogurt) 
• Yeast respires anaerobically when oxygen is absent or short in supply in their surroundings to 
make alcohol and carbon dioxide

𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 →2𝐶2𝐻5𝑂𝐻+ 2𝐶𝑂2 + 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 

• Plant roots respire anaerobically when land is flooded and soils become saturated with water so 
little or no oxygen is available  
• Far less energy is released from each molecule in anaerobic respiration compared to aerobic 
respiration 
• This is because glucose is not completely broken down and a lot of energy remains stored in 
lactic acid and in alcohol in the form of chemical bond energy  
Lactic acid 
• Lactic acid can slowly poison muscles and cause cramps so it must be removed from the body  
• The build-up of lactic acid in the muscles and blood, during vigorous exercise, causing an 
oxygen debt 
• The oxygen debt is repaid after strenuous exercise by breathing faster and deeper in order to 
supply more oxygen for aerobic respiration to break down lactic acid 
• Oxygen debt is removed during recovery by aerobic respiration of lactic acid in the liver 
• After exercise the heart continues to beat at a fast rate in order to transport lactic acid in blood 
from the muscles to the liver  
• The enzyme catalysed reactions that release most of the energy in aerobic respiration occur in 
mitochondria 
• These cell structures do not function without a supply of oxygen  
• During anaerobic respiration, glucose is partly broken down in the cytoplasm and alcohol or 
lactic acid is produced from the end product of this partial breakdown",589," All cells need energy provided by burning glucose . The energy is released gradually in a series of small, enzyme controlled reactions . In aerobic respiration oxygen is used in the breakdown of glucose . Yeast respires anaerobically when oxygen is absent or short in supply in their surroundings to make lactic acid .",Hard
biology,Unit 13 Excretion,"Excretion 
 
• Excretion is the removal from the body of the 
waste products of metabolism, toxic materials 
and substances in excess of requirements 
Excretory products  
• Carbon dioxide made in the body tissues during 
respiration, it is transported to the lungs in the 
blood plasma 
• Urea is made in the liver from excess amino 
acids 
• Substances that are excreted are produced by 
cells during metabolism 
• Substances that have been egested have been 
eaten and passed through the alimentary canal 
without being digested and absorbed into the 
bloodstream  
Assimilation  
• Assimilation means that food molecules that have been absorbed now becomes a part of the 
cells or are used by cells  
The functions of the liver as part of assimilation  
• Stores glucose by removing it from the blood and storing it as glycogen. This helps to regulate 
the concentration of glucose in the blood 
• Uses amino acids to make proteins such as fibrinogen  
• Breaks down excess amino acids 
• Converts fatty acids and glycerol into fat which is stored around the body  
• Produces cholesterol from fats  
Roles of the liver  
• The liver carries over 200 different roles in the body 
• All the blood from the digestive system flows through the digestive system before going into the 
rest of circulation  
• The liver makes bile to neutralise acid when entering the small intestine and emulsifies fat 
• The liver breaks down harmful substances such as alcohol and drugs  
Deamination  
• Excess amino acids are broken down by the liver 
• Each amino acid is broken down into two by the proves of deamination  
• One molecule is converted to carbohydrate or fat and used as a source of energy  
• The other molecule is ammonia which combines with carbon dioxide to form urea 
• This is carried to the kidneys, filtered and excreted as urine  
 

Kidney structure 
• Responsible for the excretion of urea and excess salts from the body  
• They control the concentration of water and ions in the body  
• Waste chemicals are transported to the kidney  
• Blood enters the kidneys through the renal artery 
• Inside each kidney is a complex network of filtering units called kidney tubules 
• As the blood flows through the units, small molecules such as glucose, salts, water and urea are 
forced out of the blood plasma to form the filtrate  
• The filtrate passes along the tubule and useful substances are reabsorbed into the blood  
• The volume of water reabsorbed depends on the body’s water concentration  
• If you are dehydrated the body will reabsorb as much water as possible and produce 
concentrated urine to preserve water 
• If you have taken in a lot of water or it is really cold, the kidneys will absorb less water and you 
will produce dilute urine 
• At the end of each tubule, urine is released and flows into the ureter and to the bladder where it 
is stored 
• From here it leaves the body, at intervals, through a shorter tube called the urethra  
• The renal vein carries blood with a low concentration of chemicals away from the kidneys  
Inside the kidneys  
• If you cut open the kidney lengthways, youkan see the areas; 
i. 
The cortex- a brown outer layer 
ii. 
The medulla- a reddish inner area 
iii. 
The pelvis- a white area 
• Inside each kidney are thousands of tiny tubes called kidney tubules which you can only see 
with a microscope  
• The function of the kidney tubules is to filter blood and remove waste chemicals and determine 
how much water is excreted  
• The filtering is carried out in the cortex 
• The waste chemcials and excess water are removed from the body in the urine which flows from 
the kidneys down the ureter and is stored in the bladder  
Kidney Functions 
Structure of a kidney tubule 
• Blood containing waste chemicals flows into the kidney via renal artery 
• Renal arteries branch into many arterioles, arterioles supply blood to closely packed capillaries 
called a glomerulus  
• After filtration, blood flows out of the glomerulus into another arteriole 
• Blood flows around the rest of the tubule which joins to form the renal vein  
• The kidney consists of a Bowman’s capsule at one end  
• The end of the kidney tubule drains into a collecting duct which goes through the medulla, 
empties in the pelvis and then flows into the ureter 
Filtration  
• Blood pressure in renal artery is high, blood vessel entering glomerulus is thicker than blood 
vessel leaving it, more blood entering glomerulus than leaving it, causes pressure, pressure 
causes the blood to be filtered 

• Ling of capillary is like a net, blood cells and large molecules, like blood proteins are too big to 
pass through wholes so remain in blood 
• Small molecules like urea, glucose, salts, and water pass out of the glomerulus into the  
Bowman’s capsule 
Reabsorption 
• All glucose, some salts and much water is reabsorbed in kidney tubule/nephron 
• Reabsorption requires active transport  
• Adaptations to reabsorption: 
i. 
Microvilli provide a large surface area for reabsorption 
ii. 
Numerous mitochondria provide energy for active transport 
• After reabsorption, excess salts and urea are dissolved in water  
• Fluid flows through nephron some water may be reabsorbed by body if low concentration of 
water in body 
• Fluid enters collecting ducts as urine 
• Flows from collecting duct to ureter and then bladder 
• Urine collects and stored in bladder 
• Expelled through urethra at intervals 
• Blood leaving kidneys has lower concentration of waste chemicals 
Kidney Dialysis 
• Protein in the urine indicates damage to the glomeruli, ruptured membranes allow larger 
molecules to pass through  
• A person can survive with one kidney that has only 10-15% normal function 
Dialysis  
• A tube is connected to one of the patient’s veins 
• Blood flows along the tube into the machine 
• Blood is pumped over a surface of dialysis membrane-membrane separates blood from dialysis 
fluid 
• Dialysis fluid contains glucoses and salts (in normal concentrations0 so net movement of these 
access membrane 
• Waste and urea leaves the machine in the dialysis fluid 
• Cleaned blood passes back into vein  
• Membrane is semi permeable  
• Dialysate has the same water potential as blood as it contains no excess salts 
• Dialysate contains no toxic chemicals or urea initially  
• Blood and dialysate moves in opposite directions 
• All of the toxic chemicals and urea will diffuse into the dialysate  
• Only excess water and salts diffuse across the membrane into the dialysate 
• Proteins can’t move across the membrane 
• The small arrows indicate a nett movement of substances into the blood due to a lower 
concentration of water/salts  
Advantages 
i. 
There is no shortage of dialysis machines 
Disadvantages 

i. 
Dialysis is expensive in the long run 
ii. 
Patients have to stick to a strict diet 
iii. 
Dialysis patients require treatment 3 times a week, each lasting for 4 hours 
Kidney Transport 
• Replaces the dysfunctional kidney with a healthy one from a donor 
• Blood type and tissue type needs to be matched reduces chances of rejection due to immune 
attack on new tissue 
• Immune suppressants drugs are given 
Advantages 
i. 
Transplant is completed once and doesn’t require weekly hospital treatments 
ii. 
Allows patients to lead a normal life 
Disadvantages  
i. 
Shortage of kidneys-need to match tissue and blood type 
ii. 
Patients have to take immune suppressant drugs  more susceptible to disease 
iii. 
Generally last for 8 years, immune system can reject transport immediately or after a few years",1274," Excretion is the removal from the body of the waste products of metabolism, toxic materials and substances in excess of requirements .

biology,Unit 14 Coordination and Response,"Coordination and Response 
Nervous control in humans 
• All organisms are sensitive to changes in the environment, known as stimuli, (singular stimulus) 
• Receptors are cells that detect stimuli 
• Effectors are the organs, such as glands and muscles that bring about responses 
• Glands secret useful substances and muscles contract to bring about movement 
• The actions they take as  a result are called responses  
• Two systems are involved- the sensory system for detecting changes in the environment and the 
nervous system for coordinating responses and initiating actions 
Human Nervous System 
• The human nervous system consists of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the 
peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
• The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal chord 
• The brain is protected by the skull and the spinal cord by the vertebral column 
• The cranial nervous system is connected to different parts of the body by nerves that make up 
the peripheral nervous system 
• Cranial nerves and spinal nerves are in pairs on either side of the brain and spinal cord 
respectively 
• Cranial nerves link the brain with all the organs in the head and also some in the thorax and 
abdomen 
• Spinal nerves link the brain to the arms, thorax, abdomen and legs 
• Spinal nerves leave the spinal cord in pairs through spaces between the vertebrae 
• Each nerve is made up of lots of nerve cells or neurones surrounded by a protective fibrous 
tube 
• Neurones transmit information in the form of nerve impulses which are like pulses of electricity 
passing along a wire 
Involuntary and Voluntary actions 
• Voluntary actions are under conscious control and involve the brain in decision making 
• Involuntary actions occur unconsciously without us having to think of them, but we can choose 
to control them occasionally  
• Sequence of events in a simple reflex reaction: 
𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠→𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑟→𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟→𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟→𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒 
• The coordinator is part of the body that connects information about the stimulus to the effector 
• This always happens inside the central nervous system to allow communications with other 
parts of the body and brain to be aware of stimuli 
• Inside the spinal cord, neurones from pain receptors connect with neurones to the muscles 
 
 
 

Neurones and reflex arcs 
Neurones 
• Neurones are highly specialised cells 
• Their structure allows them to transmit information as nerve impulses over long distances 
• The cell body contains nucleus and almost all of the cytoplasm 
• However, neurone have thon extensions that may be quite short but extend a long way through 
the body 
• Sensory neurones transmit impulses from sense organs to the brain and spinal cord 
• Motor neurones transmit impulses away from the brain and spinal cord to effector organs-
muscles and glands 
• Sensory and motor neurones are surrounded by insulation 
• This insulation is known as myelin, formed by separate cells that grow around the neurones to 
form a layer rich in fat 
• Relay (connector) neurones are short and pass on impulses from sensory neurones to motor 
neurones inside the brain and spinal cord 
• When any two neurones meet, they do not touch, there is a tiny gap called a synapse 
• When an impulse reaches a synapse a chemical transmitter substance is released from the first 
neurone 
• It diffuses across the synapse and triggers an impulse in the second neurone 
• Since the chemical transmitter is only produced on one side of the synapse, it ensures that 
impulses travel in one direction through the nervous system  
Reflex arcs 
• A reflex arc is the pathway of the impulse along the neurones 
• A hot flame is an example of a stimulus  
• The receptor is the heat sensor in the skin 
• When it is stimulated the heat sensor generates an impulse 
• The impulse travels to the spinal cord along a sensory neurone 
• Inside the grey matter of the spinal cord the impulse passes across a synapse to a relay neurone 
• The relay neurone passes the impulse across a second synapse to a motor neurone 
• The motor neurone transmits the impulse to a muscle in the arm 
• The muscle is the effector and it contracts to remove the hand from the hot object 
• The action is the response 
• Many reflexes are protective, they happen very quickly to prevent injury  
Synapses and drugs 
• A synapse is a junction between two neurones 
• The gap between two neurones is called the synaptic gap 
• The neurone that carries the impulse to the synapse is called the presynaptic neurone 
• The neurone that carries the impulse away from the synapse is called the postsynaptic neurone  
• Chemicals known as neurotransmitters are released by the presynaptic neurone and diffuse 
across the synaptic gap to trigger an impulse in the postsynaptic neurone  
 

Structure of the synapse  
• The axons of neurones end in swellings called synaptic bulbs 
•  The surface of the synaptic bulb is called the presynaptic membrane 
• It is separated by the synaptic gap from the postsynaptic membrane of the cell body or axon of 
the next neurone 
• The synaptic bulb has many vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules 
• It also contains many mitochondria which suggests that energy is required in synaptic 
transmission 
• The post synaptic membrane has a large number of protein molecules on its surface which act as 
receptor sites for the neurotransmitter substance 
Synaptic transmission 
1. When an impulse arrives at the synaptic bulb it causes vesicles containing the neurotransmitter 
to move across the presynaptic membrane  
2. The vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing the neurotransmitter into the 
synaptic gap 
3. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic gap and attaches to specific receptor sites on 
the post synaptic membrane. The receptor sites have a complimentary shape to the 
neurotransmitter, but the binding is only temporary 
4. The binding of the neurotransmitter triggers an impulse in the postsynaptic neurone. Once this 
has happened the neurotransmitter is broken down by an enzyme in the synaptic gap 
5. The mitochondria provide energy to reform the neurotransmitter  
 
• Nerve impulses only travel in one direction i.e. from presynaptic neurone to postsynaptic 
neurone 
• This happens because vesicles of the neurotransmitter are only present in the presynaptic bulb 
and the receptors are only found on the postsynaptic membrane  
The effect of drugs on synaptic transmission  
• Most drugs that affect the nervous system have their effects at synapses 
• These drugs influence the release of neurotransmitter s 
• Interact with receptor by either stimulating or inhibiting them  
• Amphetamines are a type of excitatory drug that increases activity in the nervous system: 
i. 
Stimulate the release of neurotransmitters in the brain, increasing brain activity, 
making the person more alert 
ii. 
They also have the effect of suppressing appetite 
• Heroin and beta-blockers are examples of inhibitory drugs, that reduce the effects on 
neurotransmitters 
• Heroin acts on the presynaptic neurones to reduce the release of neurotransmitter and this 
reduced the sensation of pain  
• Beta-blockers are drugs that block receptors for neurotransmitters and are taken by people to 
reduce blood pressure and heart rate  
 

Sense Organs 
• Sense organs are groups of receptor cells that respond to specific stimuli  
• The eyes respond to light rays and gives us our sense of sight 
• The nose responds to chemicals in the air and gives us our sense of smell 
• The tongue responds to chemicals in our food and drink and gives us our sense of taste 
• The ears respond to sound vibrations that gives us our sense of hearing, the ear also detect 
movement and position of the body, providing information about balance 
• The skin responds to pressure and gives us our sense of touch, it also detects pain and 
temperature 
Eye Structure 
• Your eye sits inside a socket in the skull and is moved about by 3 pairs of eye muscles 
• The eye is a complex of organ composed of different tissues 
• At the front of the eye is a delicate, transparent layer, through which light enters the eye 
• Light then passes through the pupil which is a hole in the centre of the pigmented iris, through 
the lens to the retina at the back of the eye 
• The retina is a tissue with light-sensitive receptor cells 
• At the very front of the eye is a delicate, transparent layer, which provides protection.  
• It is kept moist by tear glands, that clean your eyes every time you blink  
• Tears also contain lysosome, an enzyme that kills bacteria 
• What you see in front of you is called your visual field  
• Each eye views the same visual field but from a slightly different angle  
• When shutting the eyes, the two fields overlap to give stereoscopic visions, which allows us the 
ability to judge distances accurately 
• Essential for tree-dwelling animals and predators which need to judge distances accurately to 
survive 
Control of the pupil reflex 
• The size of the pupil is controlled by a pair of antagonistic muscles in the iris 
• The circular muscles are arranged around the pupil 
• The radial muscles run outwards from the pupil like spokes in a wheel 
• Antagonistic muscle pair 
• Circular muscles contract to reduce the size of the pupils 
• The radial muscles contract to increase the size of the pupils  
Focusing  
• Light enters the eye through the transparent cornea  
• Passes through the lens to be focused on the retina 
• The image is inverted because of the way the light rays reflected from the top and bottom of the 
object enter the eye and cross over behind the lens 
• Information about this inverted image goes to the brain to be interpreted the right way up 
• We learn how to do this in the first few months of life  
 
 

Rods and Cones 
• Rods and cones are light receptor cells on the retina 
• Rod cells are sensitive to light of low intensity and send impulses only when it is dark, 
responsible for night vision 
• Cone cells are only sensitive to light of high intensity 
• There are three types of cone cell, each sensitive to different wave lengths of light  
• The brain interprets impulses from cone cells to give us coloured vision 
• The fovea is the centre of the retina which contains no rods nor cones 
• Each cone has its own neurone to the brain so this area in the middle of our visual field gives us 
a detailed image 
• The rest of the retina contains rods and few cones 
• This area gives us peripheral vision which is not very detailed  
• The position of the fovea is in the centre of the retina on the horizontal level as the blind spot 
Accommodation  
• Term used to describe the changes that occur in the eye when focusing on far and near objects 
• As light enters the eye it must be refracted to see the image clearly  
• The lens is surrounded by elastic tissue that can stretch and recoil 
• The shape of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles  
Whilst seeing distant objects 
Whilst seeing close objects 
The ciliary muscles relax 
Pressure inside eye pulls sensory ligaments tight 
Lens pulled into elliptical (thin) shape 
Light rays refracted as they pass through lens and 
focus on the retina 
The distant object is in focus 
The ciliary muscles contract to counteract 
pressure in the eye 
Suspensory ligaments are slack  
Elastic tissue recoils and becomes spherical (fat) 
Light rays are refracted more 
The near image is now in focus 
 
Hormones 
The endocrine system 
• A hormone is a chemical substance produced by an endocrine glad and transported in the 
blood to alter the activity of target organs 
Adrenaline 
• Secreted by adrenal gland 
• Makes you more aware and ready to take action 
• Fight or flight reaction: 
i. 
Increasing the breathing rate 
ii. 
Increasing pulse  
iii. 
Widening pupils for more light to enter eyes 
• Stimulates increase in rate of chemical activity  
• Stimulates liver cells to convert glycogen to glucose  
• Adrenaline coordinates uptake of oxygen and changes in the blood  

Effects of adrenaline 
• Air passages widen, allow more air into alveoli, increases volume of oxygen to be absorbed 
• Breathing rate increases to increase the uptake of oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide at a 
faster rate 
• Arterioles in the brain and muscles dilate to deliver more glucose and oxygen for respiration 
in these organs 
• Arterioles in the gut and other organs constrict to deliver blood to the muscles 
• If too much adrenaline is realised, as a result of prolonged strength/anxiety, high blood 
pressure and heart disease may result 
• Beta-blockers help to reduce blood pressure and heart rate

Controlling conditions in the body 
• Homeostasis is the maintenance of constant or balanced internal conditions of the body so that 
enzymes can control metabolism efficiently  
• Negative feedback loop creates responses to counteract the effect of a variable 
• Positive feedback loop increases the intensity of the variable to trigger response  
Controlling body temperature 
The skin 
Functions: 
• Protects body from damage 
• Stops pathogen from entering  
• Prevents too much water loss 
• Detects changes in temperature 
• Detects pressure (touch) and pain  
• Loses heat by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation 
• Mammals have fur or hair which traps a layer of air close to the skin 

• Air is a poor conductor of heat 
• Air pockets reduce the amount of heat loss to the atmosphere by keeping convection currents of 
air away from the skin 
• When it is cold hair erector muscles contract so that the hair stand erect to trap a thick layer of 
air reducing heat loss 
• When it is hot hair muscles relax so hairs lie fat 
• Less air is trapped close to the skin so more heat can’t be lost via convectional currents of air 
• Mammals also have a layer of fatty tissue beneath the skin that is a good insulator 
Controlling temperature in the body 
• A very effective way to regulate body temperature is to change how much blood flows through 
the capillaries near the surface of the skin  
• Arterioles supply these capillaries with blood 
• The muscle around the arteriole can relax 
• Increase in blood flow in the capillaries 
• Known as vasodilation  
• Heat lot to surroundings by convection and radiation  
• In the cold, walls of arterioles constrict  
• Reduces blood flow through capillaries  
• Blood diverted to stay in the fatty layer in the skin 
• Known as vasoconstriction  
Tropic responses  
Gravitropism  
• A gravitropism is a growth response to the stimulus of gravity  
• Roots are positively gravitropic because they grow in the same direction as gravity 
• Shoots are negatively gravitropic, they grow in the opposite direction to gravity  
Auxin  
• Plant hormone that controls growth 
• Stimulates shoot growth by causing cells to elongate 
• Inhibits root growth by slowing down elongation  
• If a seedling is put on its side then the auxin builds up on the lower side of the shoot and root 
• In the shoot the auxin stimulates the cells there to elongate and therefore grow more on the lower 
side 
• This causes the shoot to bend upwards 
• In the root the auxin builds up on the lower side 
• Auxin slows down growth by inhibiting elongation 
• As a result the cells on the upper side of the root elongate more than those on the lower side so 
the root bends downwards 
• Auxin is made in the shoot tip 
• Auxin moves away from the shoot tip down the stem 
• Auxin is unequally distributed so most is found on the shaded side 
• The auxin stimulates the cells on the shaded side to elongate more than the cells on the side of 
direct light 

• The shoot grows more on the shaded side and bends towards the light  
• Roots are not sensitive to light 
Phototropism  
• (Positive) phototropism, or positively phototropic plants grow towards the light  
• Advantage: leaves are exposed to maximum surface area to the light 
Synthetic plant hormones 
• Synthetic auxins are very effective as selective weed killers 
• Important crops (cereals) have narrow leaves, whilst weeds have broad leaves 
• Herbicides [2,4-D] are sprayed on the crop but tend to run off the leaves of the cereal because 
they are thin and point upwards 
• The weed killers are more likely to be absorbed by the broad leaved weeds 
• The auxins increase the growth rate of the affected leaves, by increasing rate of cell division 
• The weeds cannot provide enough food from photosynthesis to maintain this rate of growth and 
will soon die",2902," The human nervous system consists of two parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system .

What are drugs? 
A drug is any substance that is taken into the body that alters or influences the chemical reactions in 
the body. 
Types of drugs 
• Some drugs are active ingredients and are used to treat/cure people from disease 
• Others are mood enhancing altering sensory perception  
• Aspirin, paracetamol, morphine and antibiotics are medical drugs designed to supress pain, 
counteract flu or kill pathogenic bacteria 
• Alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are socially acceptable drugs that people take for pleasurable 
effects, to help them relax or concentrate 
• Drugs that tend to be illegal for more severe effects are sometimes called recreational drugs 
• Hallucinogens such as Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) cause psychedelic visions 
• Stimulants like cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are mood enhancing drugs for a short lived 
feeling of well-being and energy 
• Drugs act upon the body in various ways  
• Nicotine and heroin interfere with the way the nervous system works and are addictive  
• The aforementioned drugs act at synapses in the nervous system and change the way in which 
neurones send impulses 
• They do this by combining with the protein molecules on the cell membranes of the neurones  
• The liver is the site of the breakdown of alcohol and other toxins 
• Drugs are broken down in the body by enzymes and the products are excreted 
• The breakdown of the products can be detected in urine  
• So urine tests are carried out to see if people have been taking drugs 
• Many drugs are addictive  
• If the body become reliant on the drug, the person becomes addicted and needs to take it 
regularly 
• In several countries, the possession or on non-medicinal drugs is illegal 
• The body’s metabolism may become used to the drug  
• The liver may produce more enzymes to break it down so the dose of the drug has to increase to 
have the effect that the user first experienced  
Antibiotics 
• Group of chemicals made by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) that are used to kill pathogens 
or stop their growth 
• Antibiotics are prescribed by doctors to treat diseases caused by diseases 
• Antibiotics can be injected or taken orally 
• A course of antibiotics has to be taken over a period of time 
• Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered and mass produced 
• Penicillin acts on bacteria by inhibiting cell wall formation leading to a breakdown of the cell 
wall and the leakage of cell contents  
• Some antibiotics stop substances from crossing cell membranes and others prevent bacteria 
from catalysing reactions 

• Antibiotics have no effect on viruses  
• A big problem with antibiotics is that many bacteria have become resistant to them  
• Viruses are not cell 
• They do not carry out their own metabolism and dependent on their host  
• To control viruses- we would essentially have to inhibit our own metabolism which would be 
impossible  
• This is why antibiotics are not used to treat viruses 
• There are anti-viral drugs available such as AZT which is used to treat HIV/AIDs but work 
differently to antibiotics 
• There are less anti-viral drugs than antibiotics  
• Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been caused by overuse especially in hospitals 
• Overuse was responsible for the development of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
or MRSA 
• This has caused death in hospital patients with suppressed immune systems 
• Prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and ensuring that people complete their courses of 
antibiotic treatment by taking all their pills are a way to control bacterial resistance  
Heroin  
The biology of heroin  
• Morphine and codeine are two compounds extracted from opium poppies and used as 
painkillers in medicine  
• Heroin is a compound modified from morphine  
• Heroin has only limited medial uses as it is highly addictive so rarely used  
• Heroin is a powerful depressant that slows down the nervous system  
• Heroin has a chemical structure that is similar to endorphins, a group of chemicals found in the 
brain 
• Endorphins are made naturally in the brain when the body is experiencing pain or stress 
• They work by flooding the synapses in the brain and preventing neurones from transmitting 
impulses from pain receptors, producing pain relief  
• The heroin molecules bind to the endorphin receptor sites on the post synaptic membranes of 
the synapse, blocking nerve transmission 
• This mimics the function of endorphins 
• When people take heroin for the first time they experience feelings of contentment and 
happiness, this state is known as euphoria 
Addiction to heroin  
• Heroin becomes part of the body’s metabolism and the body quickly gets used to the drug  
• This includes the nerve cells where it has its effect  
• More painkillers are needed to prevent them sending impulses to the brain 
• The feeling of pain becomes unbearable and addicts have to take heroin to reduce the pain  
• This is how the body develops tolerance and the drug has to be taken in greater quantities to 
experience euphoria or deaden pain  
• People who start taking heroin want to repeat the feelings they first experienced, but easily 
become hooked or addicted 
• This can happen within two to three weeks of misuse  

• Heroin is taken by smoking, sniffing or injecting  
• Injecting is highly dangerous as veins can collapse and tissues start to die causing gangrene 
• Long term addicts run out of places to inject it 
• Some addicts share needles and syringes which could cause HIV or hepatitis  
Social Problems 
• The drug often dominates the lives of addicts until they get their next fix 
• The drug can be expensive which leads people towards crime to sustain their habit 
• It can be difficult to keep a job, and addiction usually leads to family breakdown and 
homelessness 
• Addicts prefer the company of other addicts isolating themselves from family and friends 
• Heroin is produced in Afghanistan and the Golden Triangle (Laos, Vietnam, Burma and 
Thailand) 
• It is then illegally transported elsewhere 
• A user who stops taking the drugs experiences unpleasant withdrawal symptoms 
• These include sleeplessness, hallucinations, muscle cramps, sweating, vomiting and nausea 
• A great deal of willpower and support is needed to overcome addiction  
• Often the only way to recover is through rehabilitation  
• This may involve staying at a treatment centre 
• In some countries addicts are given another drug called methadone which gives the same effects 
as heroin  
Alcohol  
The biology of alcohol 
• When consumed, it is absorbed into the blood quickly since it is a small molecule and does not 
have to be digested  
• It is soluble in cell membranes and easily absorbed through the wall of the stomach and small 
intestine 
• The presence of food in the stomach slows down the absorption  
• Alcohol gets distributed throughout the body in the blood 
• Some is lost through the lungs and the kidneys 
• It is absorbed by liver cells and broken down by enzymes so its concentration in the blood 
decreases  
• This breakdown happens faster in men than women  
• Because men have more of these enzymes and tend to be more active 
• Men also have more water and less fat in their bodies as compared to women, which also 
decreases the concentration faster  
• Like heroin, alcohol is a depressant 
• It affects the brain by slowing down the transmission of nerve impulses  
• In small quantities this has the effect of removing inhibitions so people find it easier to be social  
• With larger quantities this lack of inhibition leads to: 
i. 
Loss of coordination, judgement and control of fine movements 
ii. 
Slower reaction times 
iii. 
Loss of self-control  
• Unlike heroin, alcohol does not lead to addiction as quickly, it at all 

• Many people drink alcohol in small to moderate quantities throughout their lives without 
becoming addicted  
• The alcohol content of drinks is measured in units 
• One unit is 8 grams of alcohol, this quantity is broken down by the liver in one hour 
• The UK government recommends that men should not drink more than between 3 to 4 units 
• And women 2 to 3 per day  
Addiction  
• Some people become dependent upon alcohol and are sometimes referred to as alcoholics 
•  They develop a tolerance as more enzymes that metabolise alcohol are made in the liver 
• They need to take greater quantities to get the same effect  
• The feel tense and irritable and find it hard to cope with everyday problems without a drinks  
Social Problems  
• The misuse of alcohol is a factor in crime, family disputes, martial breakdown, child neglect, 
absenteeism, vandalism and violent crime 
• Damage done by alcohol is considerable and difficult to measure  
• Alcohol and drugs are involved in many road accidents  
• Alcohol can disturb a person concentration but make them feel more confident 
• In some countries it is illegal to drink alcohol and then operate a car or machinery 
Long term effects of alcohol  
• Drinking in large quantities for many years can lead to stomach ulcers, heart disease and brain 
damage 
• Drinking in large quantities interferes with the metabolism of the liver causing fat to build up 
• This condition is known as fatty liver 
• The liver tissue is damaged and replaced by fibrous scar tissue  
• If heavy drinking persists then the liver becomes full of nodules 
• This condition is known as cirrhosis  
• The liver becomes less able to carry out its job of removing toxins from the blood  
• This condition is irreversible and fatal unless drinking is stopped  
• Long term consumption also leads to brain damage and personality and behavioural changes  
The misuse of drugs in sport  
• Anabolic steroids are substances similar to testosterone  
• They work by mimicking the protein-building effects of this hormone 
• The result is muscle strength resulting in increased strength and endurance 
• There are a number of harmful side effects resulting from the excessive use of anabolic steroids 
• In men: increased aggression, impotence, baldness, kidney and liver damage and development of 
breasts 
• In women: development of male features, facial and body hair and irregular periods 
Smoking and health  
• Tobacco plants make nicotine as a way to protect against insect attack (natural pesticide) 
• Nicotine’s molecular structure allows it to interact with our nervous system  

Biology of Tobacco Smoke  
Nicotine  
• Absorbed quickly through the alveoli to enter the bloodstream  
• Interacts with nerve cells at synapses 
• Stimulant  
• Makes heat beat faster, narrows arterioles which increases blood pressure  
• Increases stickiness of blood platelets that promote blood clotting  
Tar 
• A black sticky material that collects in the lungs as smoke and coals 
• Does not pass into the bloodstream  
• Irritates the lining of airways and stimulates production of mucus 
• Accumulation of mucus because cilia is damaged by smoking  
• Smokers cough to make this material move to the back of the throat 
• The chemicals compounds in tar can cause cancer and are described as carcinogenic  
Carbon Monoxide 
• Poisonous gas 
• Combines with haemoglobin thus reduces the amount of oxygen transported by 10% 
• Put added strain on a heart, as response to nicotine 
• When more oxygen is required, less blood is delivered as it flows through the coronary arteries 
to supply the heart muscle 
• If a women smokes during pregnancy, there may not be enough oxygen for the fetus to develop 
• The baby may have a smaller birth weight or be born prematurely  
Diseases caused by smoking  
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)-Collection of lung diseases including chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema  
• Effect of hot tobacco smoke on airways reduces efficiency in keeping the lungs clean  
• Cilia on the cell lining the air passages stop beating  
• Mucus, dust, dirt and bacteria stick to the airways 
• Stimulates body’s immune system sends phagocytes to the place where this happens 
(particularly bronchi) 
• Large amounts of phlegm (mucus, bacteria and white blood cells are produced and people 
attempt to cough it up 
• This is called chronic bronchitis  
• People with this condition find it difficult to move air in and out of their lungs as bronchi are 
partially blocked 
• Particles, bacteria and tar reach the alveoli 
• Phagocytic white blood cells digest a pathway through the lining of the alveoli to reach them  
• Eventually this weaken the wall of the alveoli so much that they break down and burst 
• Reducing the surface area for gas exchange 
• This condition is known as emphysema  

• Which leaves people gasping for breath as they cannot absorb oxygen or remove carbon dioxide 
efficiently  
• Many long term smokers have both of these conditions  
• The cause of lung cancer is the carcinogens in tar  
• They promote DNA changes of cells lining the airways 
• The cells grow and divide out of control 
• The growth is slow but eventually may form a small group of cells known as a tumour  
• If this is not discovered, it may occupy a larger space obstructing airways and blood vessels  
• A part of the tumour may break off and spread to other organs  
Heart disease 
• Tobacco smoke increases the chances that fat will deposit in the walls of the artery 
• As nicotine increases the chance that blood will clot, there is an increased risk of developing 
CHD 
• Blocked arteries reduce the supply of oxygen to the heart and this damages the heart muscle",2281," A drug is taken into the body that alters or influences the chemical reactions in the body .

biology,Unit 16 Reproduction,"Reproduction 
• Reproduction means producing new living organisms. Animals and plants reproduce to make 
new individuals of the same species. There are two types of reproduction: asexual and sexual 
reproduction  
Asexual reproduction  
• In asexual reproduction there is only one parent  
• All the offspring are identical to the parent as they inherit exactly the same genetic information 
• They are genetically identically identical to the parent, which means there is little variation 
amongst the offspring  
• Bacteria: the bacterial cell divides into two making a new cell wall. This type of asexual 
reproduction is called binary fission, because the parent cells splits into two 
• Pin mold is a fungus which grows on bread 
• It reproduces asexually by making spores 
• There are small and light, like specs of dusts and they float through the air 
• When a spore lands on a damp surface it splits open and a thread grows out  
• This thread or hypha, grows over the surface of the bread forming a dense network of threads 
called a mycelium  
• Eventually short hyphae grow upwards and produce spore cases or sporangia at their tips. 
• Inside each sporangium hundreds of new spores are formed asexually by division of the nuclei 
• Each nucleus gains a small quantity of cytoplasm and protective spore case 
• When ready, sporangia break open and the spores are dispersed  
• Potatoes reproduce asexually by means of stem tubers, which are swollen underground stems 
that grow from the parent plant  
• Sucrose is transported in the phloem from the leaves into these underground stems that swell as 
they convert the sucrose into starch  
• The parent plant dies at the end of the growing season leaving the tubers in the ground to 
survive over the winter  
Sexual reproduction  
• In sexual reproduction there are two parents  
• The parents have sex organs  
• The sex organs make sex cells or gametes  
• In animals, the male gametes are sperm cells  
• In flowering plants the male gametes are nuclei inside pollen grains 
• In animals, the female gametes are egg cells 
• In flowering plants the female gametes are inside structures called ovules 
• The fertilized egg or zygote divides to form an embryo which may grow into a new individual 
plant  
• At fertilization, half the genetic materials comes from the male gamete and half comes from the 
female gamete  
• The nuclei in the gametes contain one set of chromosomes  
•  A zygote has a nucleus that contains two sets of chromosomes-one from each gamete  
• Unlike asexual reproduction, the offspring produced are not genetically identical to the parents  

• This means that sexual reproduction brings about variation in the offspring  
Advantages and disadvantages of asexual reproduction in plants  
• Asexual reproduction is fast 
• If left in the ground, potato tubers grow into new plants in the same place as the parent, but 
compete with each other for resources 
• Seeds produced in sexual reproduction may be dispersed to new areas where there may not be 
as much competition  
• However, many seeds land in unsuitable places for growth so many are wasted 
• There is very little, if any, variation as a result of asexual reproduction  
• This can be a disadvantage if these individuals are affected by a certain disease 
• Disease could spread very quickly through crop monoculture, in which all the plants are 
genetically identical  
• If environmental conditions change, it is unlikely that there will be individuals with features to 
adapt to these mew conditions 
• Sexual reproduction gives a rise to variation 
• If there is plenty of variation, species are better able to survive and evolve  
Flower Structure 
• Flowering plants carry out sexual reproduction by producing flowers, which have male and 
female parts  
• The male parts make pollen grains to carry male gametes to the female parts 
• The transfer of pollen grains is pollination 
• Female gametes are deep inside the female part and pollen grain grow a tube to reach them 
• Each pollen tube delivers a male gamete so it can fuse with the female gamete to form a zygote 
• Fusion of male and female gametes is fertilization  
Flowers vary in structure depending upon their method of pollination  
Insect pollinated flowers 
Flower parts are often arranged in rings attached to the end if a swollen flower stalk. The sepals form 
the outer ring and the carpels form the inner ring. 
• Sepals are leaf-like structures that protect the flower when it is a bud 
• Petals are brightly colored and scented. Many have nectary at the base, which makes sugary 
nectar. Visiting insects land on the petals to feed on nectar 
• Stamens are the male sex organs. Each one is made up of two [arts: the anther, where the pollen 
is made, and the filament, a stalk which holds the anther,  
• Carpels are the female sex organs. Each carpel is made up of a stigma, a style and an ovary  
• The ovules are inside the ovary. Each ovule has a female gamete- the egg cell 
• Pollen grains are often spiky and sticky 
• The grains are adapted to attach to hairs in the surfaces of insect bodies 
• The grains become dislodged onto a stigma when an insect enters another flower of the same 
species 
 

Wind pollinated flowers  
• Grasses and cereals are all pollinated by the wind  
• The flowers are small, green and inconspicuous compared to insect pollinated flowers 
• They have no scent and no nectar  
• The anthers produce pollen grains that are small, smooth and light so that they are easily 
carried on the wind  
• These flowers make huge numbers of pollen grains as the chances if pollen grains landing on a 
stigma are very small  
• The anthers hang outside the flower so the wind can blow away pollen  
• The feathery stigmas are also positioned outside the flower 
• They act like a net, providing a large surface area for catching pollen grains that get blown into 
them  
• Wind pollination can waste a lot of pollen, which is why the anthers produce so much 
• But the fact that plants such as grasses and cereals grow close to one another means that pollen 
is more likely to be transferred than if they are separated by large distances 
Pollination  
• Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of the male part of the flower to the 
stigma of the female part of the flower 
• Self-pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower 
or a different flower on the same plant  
• Cross pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of 
another flower on a different plant of the same species 
• The benefit of cross pollination is that it results in greater variation in which natural selection 
can operate on

Fertilization and seed formation  
• If a pollen grain lands on a ripe stigma it starts to grow a pollen tube to take the male nucleus to 
the female nucleus 
• Fertilization occurs when the male nucleus fuses with the female nucleus 
• This occurs inside the ovule 

• Each pollen grain grows a pollen tube to take the male nucleus to the ovule 
• As it grows, the pollen tube gains nutrition from the tissues of the style and carries nutrition 
from the tissues of the style and carries the male gamete nucleus with it  
• The first pollen tube reaches the ovary 
• It enters the ovule through a small hole-the micropyle 
• The male gamete and then fuses with the egg cell nucleus  
• This is fertilization in which a zygote is formed by fusion of the two nuclei  
Seed Formation 
• After fertilization, the zygote divides and grows into the embryo 
• The ovule forms the seed with the embryo inside it  
• The ovary forms the fruit with the seeds inside it  
• Many of the parts of the flower are not needed when fertilization has occurred, so the sepals, 
petals and stamens, wither and fall off  
• Each fertilized ovule grows to form a seed, each seed is made up of: an embryo, an energy store 
and a seed coat/testa 
• The ovary forms the fruit  
Condition for germination  
• Water is needed for the seeds to swell. This swelling breaks the seed coats of some seeds. Cells 
absorb water, develop vacuoles and expand. Cell expansion makes the radicle (embryonic root) 
grow out from the seed. Water is also needed to dissolve the soluble products made by enzymes 
from the food stores. Water also activated these enzymes. 
• Oxygen is needed for aerobic respiration to provide the embryo with energy  
• A suitably warm temperature is needed so that the enzymes can work efficiently  
The Male Reproductive System  
• The testes are the male sex organs  
• They produce the male gametes/spermatozoa/sperm 
• The testes also male testosterone  
• This stimulates changes in a boy’s body as he develops into an adult during puberty 
• This happens between about 10 and 16 years of age 
• The testes are located inside a sac called the scrotum which hangs outside the body 
• This keeps the testes at a cooler temperature as sperm cells need at temperature of lower that 
37°C to develop properly and be stored 
• After puberty, the testes constantly produce sperm cells which are stored in small tubules just 
outside the testes where they mature 
• A much wider tube called the sperm duct connects these tubules to the urethra  
• The prostate gland and other glands secrete fluids in which sperm cells can swim  
• The prostrate secretes mucus and other glands secrete sugars which sperm cells use as a 
source of energy for their respiration  
• Sperm cells and the fluid together form semen, also known as seminal fluid  
• The two sperm ducts join with the urethra, which runs down the center of the penis 
• Urine and semen never pass down urethra at the same time  

• A ring of muscle around the urethra contracts to prevent the loss of any urine from the bladder 
during sexual intercourse  
Male and Female gametes 
• Gametes are sex cells  
• The male gamete is called the sperm  
• The female gamete is called the ovum or egg 
• The sperm cell is a specialized cell that is adapted for swimming by having a flagellum that 
lashes from side to side 
• Sperm cells carry genetic information from the male parent to the female parent  
• The nucleus contains the father’s chromosomes 
• An egg is bigger than a sperm because it provides the food store that supports the embryo after 
fertilization  
• An egg cells is fertilized by a sperm cell  
• The head of the sperm contains enzymes to help it reach the surface of the egg cell  
• The cell membrane of the sperm cell fuses with the egg cell membrane  
• The sperm nucleus moves through the cytoplasm of the egg and the two nuclei fuse together to 
form a zygote (fertilized egg) 
• After fertilization, the jelly coat changes, so that no more sperm can enter

taking a contraceptive pill 
 
• Each sperm cell has mitochondria, which releases energy to power the swimming by the tail  
• The acrosome contains enzyme that digest a pathway through the jelly coat surrounding the egg 
The Female Reproductive System 
• Ovaries are female sex organs that produce the female gametes called ova or eggs  
• The ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone, which starts to happen 
with girls between 10 and 15 years of age during puberty  
• Estrogen stimulates the development of the sex organs and secondary sexual characteristics in 
a girl’s body as she starts to develop into an adult  
• Progesterone prepares the uterus so that it is ready to receive an embryo in the case of 
pregnancy  
• The ovaries are attached to the inside of the abdomen just below the kidneys 

• After puberty, an egg is released from an ovary about every 28 days  
• The ovaries tend to release an egg or eggs on alternate months  
• The egg passes out of the ovary and into the funnel shaped opening of the oviduct in a process 
called ovulation  
• The egg moves slowly down the oviduct towards the uterus (womb) 
• If sperm cells are present in the oviduct the egg will be fertilized  
• If the egg is not fertilized it will die after about a day  
• If the egg is fertilized it will divide to form an embryo which may attach itself to the lining of the 
uterus where it develops into a fetus  
• The lower end of the uterus has a ring of muscle called the cervix 
• It leads to a muscular tube called the vagina that opens to the outside of the body  
• Above the opening of the vagina is the opening of the urethra through which urine from the 
bladder passes out  
• Above the urethra is the sensitive clitoris 
• The outer opening of the vagina is called the vulva  
• The vagina is sometimes known as the birth canal, as it through here that a baby passes at birth  
Sexual Intercourse 
• During sexual intercourse males and females stimulate each other  
• Blood is pumped into special spongy tissue in the penis so that it becomes erect  
• The erect penis is placed into the vagina during sexual intercourse  
• Fluid made by the walls of the vagina lubricates movements of the penis within the vagina  
• This movement stimulates the penis and contractions begin in the sperm ducts to move sperm 
cells from the tubules around the testes towards the penis  
• As they flow, secretion from the glands including the prostate gland are added to form the semen 
or seminal fluid 
• Contractions of the urethra move the seminal fluid through the penis into the vagina  
• This is an ejaculation and the man experiences feelings of pleasure called an orgasm  
• Repeated movements of the penis against the clitoris or against the vagina walls may also 
produce orgasms for the woman 
Fertilization and Implantation  
Human fertilization  
• Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of a sperm cell fuses with the nucleus of an egg cell  
• After intercourse, sperm cells swim through the mucus in the cervix into the uterus and then all 
the way to the oviduct  
• Many sperm cells do not survive this difficult which is why so many sperm cells are produced  
• To increase the chance of some of them reaching the oviduct  
• If there is an egg in the oviduct, a sperm cell may succeed in penetrating it  
• Enzymes released by the acrosome on the head of the sperm digest a pathway through the jelly 
coat surrounding the egg 
• After the sperm membrane has fused with the egg membrane the nucleus enters the egg 
cytoplasm and the flagellum is left outside  
• The sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote nucleus which is diploid as it 
contains two sets of chromosomes 

• This stops other sperm cells from entering so only one sperm is able to fertilize the egg 
• If there is no egg in the oviduct, no fertilization can take place  
• However, the sperm can stay alive for 2 or 3 days  
• So if intercourse happened just before ovulation, the sperm can fertilize an egg released during 
this time  
 Implantation  
• Fertilization takes place in the oviduct  
• After this, the fertilized egg or zygote begins to divide  
• It divides once to form a two-celled embryo  
• Then it continues to divide to give four cells, then eight but after a while this cycle of divisions 
becomes less regular  
• Some cells continue to divide while other stop or slow down the rate at which they divide 
• After a few hours the embryo is a hollow ball of cell 
• It moves down the oviduct, pushed along by peristaltic contraction of the oviduct and the beating 
of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the oviduct  
• It may take a number of days for the embryo to the reach the uterus  
• The embryo embeds into the soft lining of the uterus  
• This is called implantation  
• The uterus lining has thickened in preparation and contains numerous blood vessels 
• The embryo obtains nutrients and oxygen from these blood vessels by diffusion  
• Carbon dioxide and chemical waste diffuse out in the opposite direction  
Pregnancy  
• Pregnancy is the period of time between fertilization and birth, which in humans is 9 months  
• This period of time is called the gestation period  
• After the embryo has implanted into the lining of the uterus, it grows projection into the soft 
tissue to gain nutrients and oxygen to support its growth  
• These projection continue to grow into the placenta 
• An umbilical cord grows to attach the fetus to the placenta so it fills the amniotic sac which 
surrounds it  
• The placenta is the site of oxygen and nutrients for carbon dioxide and other wastes; they diffuse 
between fetal blood and maternal blood 
• The fetus obtains all its food from its mother. It produces some urea which diffuses into the 
mother’s blood to be excreted through her kidneys  
• The umbilical cord attaches the fetus to the placenta. The cord contains an artery that transports 
deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta and a vein that returns oxygenated blood to 
the fetus  
• The amniotic sac make amniotic fluid to surround and protect the fetus against mechanical 
damage 
• Amniotic fluid is formed from filtered blood has a composition similar to plasma. Cells from the 
fetus’ skin are shed into the amnion sac and when the organs have developed the fetus carries 
out breathing movements taking fluid into the lungs. The fetus urinates the fluid and rinks it, it 
does not provide any nutrients for the fetus  

• The placenta acts as a barrier to toxins and pathogens. However, even though the womb is a 
sterile environment, the fetus is still susceptible to disease.  
• Rubella can case deafness and blindness in the fetus  
• The HIV virus that causes AIDs may cross the placenta so a baby may be born HIV positive if the 
mother is affected 
• However, with careful management the virus may not be transmitted to the fetus  
Main stages in the development into a baby to be born 
• One month after fertilization, a human embryo looks a bit like a fish embryo or tadpole. The 
embryo does not yet have arms or legs but it is clear where these will develop. The heart has 
started to beat 
• Two months after fertilization the embryo has a face, limbs, fingers and toes and looks human. It 
is now called a fetus. Most of the organs are formed  
• Three months after fertilization the nerves and the muscles of the fetus are developing rapidly  
• Five months after fertilization, although only about 180 mm in length, the fetus has perfectly 
formed eyebrows, fingernails, fingerprints and body hair. Its movement may have been felt by the 
mother for the last month  
• Seven months after fertilization development is almost complete  
Ante-Natal Care and Birth  
• Ante-natal care is the care before birth and it is vital for health of the fetus in the womb  
• A pregnant woman will need to ensure that she gets adequate quantities of: 
✓ Calcium as the bones of the fetus are growing  
✓ Iron so her body can make the extra red blood cells needed to carry oxygen to the fetus 
✓ Carbohydrates so that the pregnant woman has enough energy to carry her heavier body 
around  
✓ Protein to provide amino acids for the making of tissue in the mother’s uterus for birth 
and new tissues in the developing fetus  
• The mother should not smoke since nicotine and carbon monoxide cross the placenta can result 
in premature or underweight  
• She should not drink alcohol, as it can cause a variety of effects including birth defects and 
mental defects  
• Drugs, such as heroine can diffuse across the placenta so the babies may be born addicted to 
heroine  
Birth 
• A normal pregnancy takes about 9 months  
• Some babies can be born prematurely perhaps because there has been a problem during 
pregnancy  
• An early breaking of amnion membrane around the fetus for the most common reason  
• A few weeks before birth, the fetus usually turns over inside the uterus 
• This positions its head above the cervix 
• Hormones released by the fetus and the build-up of pressure in the uterus stimulate hormonal 
changes in the mother  
• A hormone, oxytocin, is released from her pituitary gland that stimulates the muscles of the 
uterus to contract  

• The mother starts to feel small contractions of the uterus wall. This is the beginning of labor 
• These contractions become stronger and more frequent  
• Stronger contractions become stronger and more frequent  
• Stronger contractions slowly stretch the opening of the cervix and the amnion breaks, allowing 
the amniotic fluid to escape  
• The muscles of the uterus wall now contract very strongly and start to push the baby towards 
the cervix 
• The cervix widens or dilated and the baby’s head is pushed through the vagina  
• This part of birth takes place quite quickly  
• As soon as it is born the baby breathes for the first time  
• It is important that the baby has airways clear if mucus and can breather easily  
• The umbilical cord is tied and cut just above the point where it attached to the baby  
• The remains of the cord heal to form the baby’s navel 
• After a few minutes the placenta comes away from the uterus wall. it is pushed out of the vagina 
as the afterbirth  
• The process of labor with the muscular contractions of the uterus is painful for the mother  
• Pain killing drugs can also be given to ease the pain during birth  
• These may be given by an epidural 
• This involves inserting a catheter (tube) into the space between the spine and the spinal cord 
• The drugs prevents the transmission of impulses from pain receptors in the brain  
Breast Feeding  
Advantages  
Disadvantages  
Contains antibodies aiding passive immunity 
Can be embarrassing for the mother 
The child is less likely to develop some cancers 
and diabetes 
Mother may not be able to produce enough milk 
The mother is less likely to develop womb, breast 
and ovarian cancer 
Painful for mother 
Promotes bonding with the mother 
Father may feel secluded 
 
Breast milk vs formula 
• Breast milk contains antibodies 
• No sterilizing of equipment needed 
• No mixing of powder or need for boiled water 
• Cost nothing vs. expensive formula 
• HIV positive mothers may not be able to breast feed so formula is the only alternative 
Sex Hormones  
• You are born with a complete set of sex hormones but only become active later on in life, called 
puberty  
• Girls usually develop earlier than boys 
• The actual age of puberty varies from person to person  
• The changes that take place are all controlled by the hormones  

• At the beginning of puberty the pituitary gland at the base of the brain starts to make hormones 
that stimulate the testes and hormones  
• These make the sex organs active  
• The sex organs start to produce hormones which develop our secondary sexual characteristics  
Puberty in boys 
The testes start making testosterone which stimulates: 
• The growth of the male sex organs  
• The testes to make sperm cells 
• Growth of hair on the face  
• The deepening of the voice  
• Development of muscles in the body  
Puberty in girls  
The ovaries start making estrogen which stimulates: 
• The growth of the female sex organs  
• The start of the first menstrual cycle and the first period 
• Growth of hair on parts of the body  
• Growth and the development of breasts 
• Widening of the hips  
Menstrual Cycle  
Hormone  
Where it is produced  
Function 
FSH (Follicle 
Stimulating Hormone) 
Pituitary gland 
Stimulates the formation/maturation of an egg cell 
in the follicle 
Stimulates the formation of estrogen  
LH (Luteinizing 
Hormone) 
Pituitary gland 
Stimulates the thickening of endothelium lining  
Triggers the release if a mature egg from follicle 
Estrogen  
Ovary- follicle cells 
Inhibits the secretion of FSH 
Stimulates the secretion of LH 
Progesterone  
Ovary- corpus luteum 
Helps to maintain thickened lining of the 
endothelium  
 
Day 1 -5 
Ovary: 
• FSH secreted by the pituitary gland to stimulate the maturation of one/more follicles in the ovary  
• The egg is stored in the follicle  
Uterus: 
• The endothelium breaks down leading to menstruation  
 
 

Day 5-14 
Ovary: 
• Follicle keeps maturing  
Uterus: 
• FSH stimulates the secretion of estrogen by the follicle cells: the ovarian tissues starts to 
prepare the endometrium lining  
• Estrogen inhibits the secretion of FSH and stimulates the secretion of LH  
• Lining of the endothelium thickens 
Day 14/15 
• Ovary: LH also secreted by the pituitary gland trigger the release of the egg from follicle into the 
fallopian tube  
Day 15-28 
• Ovary: remains of follicle is called the yellow body (corpus lutem) which secretes progesterone  
• Uterus: progesterone secreted by the yellow body and the presence of estrogen keeps the 
endometrium thick, waiting for possible embryo implant. Inhibits the secretion of LH and FSH  
• Day 28: Scenario 1: The egg is not fertilized  
• No implantation takes place, the corpus lutem degenerated, causing a lack of progesterone 
• This means the endometrium lining is no longer thick  
• Back to day 1 
• Day 28: Scenario 2: Egg is fertilized 
• Implantation occurs. Embryo stimulates the yellow body to keep on forming progesterone and 
estrogen. Maintains the endometrium and inhibits FSH and LH formation.  
Methods of birth control  
• Birth control allows couples to decide when, and how many children they want to have  
• To prevent pregnancy the birth control should either: 
i. 
Stop the sperm from reaching the egg 
ii. 
Stop the eggs from being made 
iii. 
Stop the fertilized egg from implanting and developing in the uterus 
Barrier methods 
• The cap or diaphragm is a rubber dome. The woman places it over her cervix before intercourse. 
It prevents the man’s sperm from entering the uterus. It should be cleaned with sperm-killing 
cream or foam  
• The condom is a thin rubber tube. It is rolled over a man’s erect penis before intercourse. It stops 
sperm from entering the woman’s body. It also gives protection against STIs.  
• A femidom is the female equivalent of a condom and is inserted into the vagina.  
Chemical methods 
• The IUD (intra-Uterine Device) is a small plastic device that is wrapped in copper or contains 
hormones. It is fitted inside the woman’s uterus and it is thought to work by preventing sperm 

passing through the uterus. It may also prevent an embryo from implanting in the uterus should 
conception occur 
• IUS (intra-uterine system) is a small T-shaped device that is placed in the uterus. It contains 
progesterone that is released slowly and causes the mucus in the cervix to become thick and 
sticky, making it unlikely that sperm will swim through  
• The pill is an oral contraceptive taken by mouth. They contain estrogen and progesterone in 
varying concentrations. There are also progesterone-only pills. These work by preventing the 
release of eggs. As a result, no eggs mature to be released by the ovaries and so pregnancy 
does not occur. This pill has to be taken every day 
• It is a reliable and convenient form of contraception  
• However, failure to take the pill regularly can result in pregnancy 
• The side effects of the pill include: sore breasts, weight gain, depression and painful periods 
• In a very small number of women, the pill can be the cause of heart and circulation problems 
• A contraceptive implant is a small flexible rod that is placed just under the skin of the upper arm. 
It releases progesterone which prevents ovulation and works for up to 3 years 
• Contraceptive injections also contain progesterone. There are different types that work between 
8 and 13 weeks  
• Spermicides are chemicals that kill sperm. They are sold as foam, cream or jelly. The woman 
puts the cream into her vagina before intercourse. Spermicides are not very effective on their 
own and should be used with another method  
Natural methods  
• Abstinence  
• Rhythm method- this relies on determining when ovulation is most likely to occur and abstaining 
from sex in the days just before and after that date  
• A woman keeps a record of when she has her periods and then predicts each month when 
ovulation should occur 
• This is about 2 weeks after having her period  
• This is not a very reliable method, especially in women who do not have very regular periods 
• Symptoms based method-e.g. checking for an increase in body temperature and changes in 
cervical mucus that becomes wetter and less sticky just before ovulation. 
Surgical methods 
• Vasectomy- a man’s sperm tubes are cut and tied. The operation is not usually reversible. The 
man can still ejaculate but there are no sperm in the semen, just fluid  
• Sterilization- a woman’s oviducts are cut and blocked.  
Control of fertility  
Fertility drugs 
• Couples are regarded as being infertile if they have had regular, unprotected sexual intercourse 
for 12 months without the woman becoming pregnant 
• The most common cause of infertility in women is that the woman does not release eggs 
• This may be due to the lack of FSH 
• Treatment for this type of infertility may involve regular injection of a fertility drug containing 
FSH 

• Other treatments involve tablets that make the pituitary insensitive to estrogen  
• Estrogen inhibits the production of FSH  
• So if the effect of estrogen on the pituitary is blocked by the drug, the pituitary continues to 
releases FSH and ovulation occurs 
• Unfortunately, fertility treatment does not always work for a variety of reasons that may not be 
easy for doctors to discover 
• Or it may work to well resulting, in twins, triplets or even quadruplets 
Artificial insemination  
• Some couples cannot have kids because the male in infertile 
• This may be because does not produce enough sperm or they are problems with ejaculation  
• It is possible that semen may be collected from them man and placed via a fine plastic tube into 
the woman’s uterus. This process is called artificial insemination (AI). 
• If the man does not produce enough sperm for this, or if the sperm is defective then a donor may 
provide a sample of semen for the AI. 
• AI by a donor can lead to problems later in life because the child’s father is not the biological 
father who probably remains unknown 
In vitro fertilization  
• Egg and sperm are collected from potential parents and mixed together in a laboratory dish 
where fertilization occurs 
• To increase the chances of success, the woman is often injected with FSH to stimulate the 
development of several follicles so that several eggs can be collected from her ovaries 
• A small incision is made in the body wall and a fine plastic tube inserted to collect the eggs from 
the follicles on the surface of the ovaries  
• The eggs are kept in a solution that contains nutrients and oxygen  
• Semen is collected from the man/sperm donor and is mixed with the eggs and left for up to 24 
hours for fertilization to occur 
• A technician checks that fertilization has occurred and that the zygotes have started to divide 
into embryos 
• These are kept in the solution for a few days and then the doctor places them into the woman’s 
uterus  
• If the procedure is successful, the embryo will develop into a fetus  
• It is also possible to take the nucleus from a defective sperm cell and inject it into an egg 
• The zygote is then cultured for several days so it grows into an embryo and is transferred into 
the woman in the hope that it implants in the uterus  
The social implication of contraception and fertility treatments 
• IVF is an expensive procedure and is not available to all 
• Success rates for IVF are often about 30% for woman under 35 years of age 
• In countries with a publically funded NHS decisions have to be made about who receives IVF and 
how many repeats should be done if the first one in unsuccessful 
• In many parts of the world, childless couples are unable to afford this treatment 
• A problem is what to do with spare embryos that are implanted 
• Some maintain that it is not acceptable to just dispose of them or use them for medical research  

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
• A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a disease that is transmitted via body fluids during 
sexual contact.  
• STIs include HIV, syphilis and gonorrhea amongst the major infection that can be transmitted 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
• The main type of cell that it infects is a type of lymphocyte  
• HIV may lead to the development of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) 
• If someone has been infected with HIV they are known as HIV+ 
• The virus weakens the body’s immune system  
• It is easier for the HIV+ person to be infected by other diseases such as TB and pneumonia  
• People who do not have HIV are described as HIV negative 
HIV and lymphocytes 
• HIV attacks and destroys an important type of lymphocyte that coordinated the immune system 
• During an infection these lymphocytes stimulate other lymphocytes to produce antibodies 
• During an HIV infection the number of these T lymphocytes decreases is fewer antibodies are 
produced every time there is another infection  
• By reducing the number of T lymphocytes, HIV weakens the body’s ability to fight disease 
• Eventually the person infected with HIV will succumb to any number of other infections because 
of their weakened immune system  
• AIDS is the name given to a collection of diseases brought on by the weakening of the body’s 
immune system  
• The early symptoms of AIDS are very much like flu, with swollen glands and a high temperature.  
• Later the symptoms may include weight loss, various types of cancer and a decrease in brain 
function 
• Not all HIV+ people develop AIDS 
• Some remain HIV+ without any symptoms at all  
How is HIV transmitted? 
• HIV is transmitted in the blood and semen 
• The virus can pass from one person to another during unprotected sex 
• The virus can also be passed via hypodermic needles contaminated with infected blood 
• In this way, HIV is spread quickly amongst drug addicts who share needles 
• Unborn babies are also at risk of HIV 
• This is because the virus can pass across the placenta to the fetus  
• Even more likely is its passage from the mother’s blood at birth when the two bloodstreams 
come into close contact  
• HIV can also be transmitted in breast milk  
• Blood used for transfusions is another way which HIV has been transmitted  
How can HIV/AIDs be prevented? 
• There is no cure for HIV/AIDS and no vaccine for HIV 
• There are anti-viral drugs e.g. AZT, and some of these prevent the virus from multiplying inside 
the body cells  

• Antibiotics do not work against viruses, but people with AIDs tale them to treat the bacterial and 
fungal infections that they have 
• Since HIV cannot be cured, it is important to prevent the transmission of the virus 
• Contact tracing is used to identify people who may have been put at risk either as a result of sex 
or the sharing of needles 
• These people are offered an HIV test which reveals the presence of HIV antibodies in their blood 
• However, the antibodies only appear after several weeks of the person being infected 
• Other methods to reduce the spread include: 
✓ The use of condoms to provide a physical barrier to transmission of the virus during sex 
✓ Setting up free needle exchange schemes for people who inject drugs 
✓ Screening donated blood for HIV antibodies and eliminating contaminated blood 
✓ Educational programs that make people aware of HIV and how it can be prevented",6377," Reproduction means producing new living organisms . Animals and plants reproduce to make  new individuals of the same species . There are two types of reproduction: asexual and sexual . In asexual reproduction there is only one parent .  Potatoes reproduce asexually by means of stem tubers, which are swollen underground stems  that grow from the parent plant . Potatoes are transported in the phloem from the leaves into these underground stems that swell as they convert sucrose into starch .  Wind pollinated flowers are small, green and inconspicuous compared to insects pollinated by the wind . Cross pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of  another flower on a different plant of the same species .

biology,Unit 17 Inheritance,"Inheritance 
Chromosomes, genes and DNA 
• The transfer of features from one generation to the next is called inheritance  
• The characteristics are controlled by genes which are like coded instructions 
• The study of inheritance is known as genetics 
• Genes from one generation are transmitted to the next in the gametes 
• At fertilization, the gametes fuse to form a zygote which contains the genetic information from both 
parents  
• A new individual grows from the zygote-half of its genetic information comes from its male parent 
and half from its female  
Chromosomes  
• A chromosome is a thread of DNA, made up of a string of genes 
• There 46 chromosomes in the nucleus of a human cell 
•  This is called the diploid number 
• The chromosomes are different shapes and sizes 
• They can be sorted into pairs based on their shape and size 
• Chromosomes are made out of a long chain molecules called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) 
• DNA is wound around molecules of protein 
• During cell division the DNA and protein are packed very tightly together and the chromosomes 
are coiled up 
• At other times they are uncoiled so the cell can use the information in the DNA 
Genes 
• Genes are lengths of DNA 
• Each chromosome has many genes along its length, although the actual number depends on its 
length 
• Each gene is a unit of inheritance in that it codes for a specific protein  
• It is a chemical code that the cell interprets as an instruction to make a protein molecule 
• Human have between 20 000 to 25 000 different genes  
• The proteins produced by cells influence how the body works and what it look like 
• Some features that genes control are influenced by the environment (height i.e. diet & exercise) 
• Other genes are not affected by the environment (e.g. blood group) 
Protein synthesis 
• The length of DNA, making up a particular gene carries the information needed to make a 
particular protein.  
• Inside every cell, there are thousands of different chemical reactions taking place 
• Enzymes control all these chemicals  
• DNA determines which enzymes are produced in each cell and therefore which chemical reaction 
take place inside cells 
• The structure of DNA contains bases 
• The information is found in the sequence of bases along the length of DNA 
• These determine the sequence of amino acids in the protein  

• DNA also controls the production of antibodies and receptors for neurotransmitters 
• DNA carries information to build proteins from amino acids 
• The information moves from the DNA to the site of the protein synthesis in the ribosomes by a 
kind of messenger molecule 
• This molecule is mRNA (messenger RNA) 
• The role of mRNA is to carry a copy of the base sequence on DNA out of the nucleus to the 
ribosomes in the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs 
The genetic code  
• There are four different bases found in DNA (A,T, C and G) 
• Each amino acid is coded for by a different base triplet on DNA 
• When mRNA copies the code on DNA it does so by the rule of base pairing 
• However, mRNA does not have the base T-this is replaced by another base U (uracil) 
• Therefore A on DNA will code for U on mRNA 
The coded information on mRNA is used to assemble amino acids in the correct sequence for each 
protein. 
• The mRNA arrives at the ribosomes from the nucleus 
• The mRNA strand contains the base triplets for each particular amino acid in the protein  
• The mRNA then passes through the ribosomes and each ribosome assembles amino acids into 
protein molecules 
• The amino acids bond together forming a long chain-the protein 
• The specific order of amino acids is determined by the sequence of the bases in the mRNA and 
each amino acid is joined to the next one by a peptide bond 
All body cells in an organism contain the same genes. However, in a particular cell many genes may not 
be expressed because the cell makes only the specific proteins it needs  
Mitosis 
• Mitosis is a type of nuclear division that occurs during growth and asexual reproduction. The 
daughter cells are genetically identical 
• Before a cell can divide, new copies of genetic information in the DNA of the chromosomes must 
be made 
• This copying process occurs before the nucleus divides 
• While it is going on, the DNA in the chromosomes is uncoiled and arranged very loosely in the 
nucleus 
• The new copy of DNA of each chromosome is attached to the original copy 
• As mitosis begins, the DNA coils up so that each chromosome becomes thicker  
• During mitosis, the two copies separate so each new cell gets a copy of each chromosome  
• As a result of mitosis, each daughter cell has the same chromosome number as the original parent 
cell 
• As the chromosomes have been copied by a reliable system, they are genetically identical to each 
other and to the parent cell 
• If they were genetically different they would be rejected by the body’s immune system  
•  
 

The Significance of mitosis 
Mitosis is important for the following processes: 
• Growth  
• Repair of wounds 
• Replacement of cells that wear out and die 
• Asexual reproduction  
Stem Cells 
• Some of the cells that form an embryo remain as unspecialized cells 
• They do not develop into any type of specialized cell 
• These cells keep dividing by mitosis to provide the body with a constant supply of new cells 
• These cells are needed to replace cells that get worn out and die 
• Each time a stem cell divides, one daughter cells starts to become specialized for some specific 
function  
• The other daughter cells remains unspecialized and undergoes mitosis again  
Meiosis 
• Meiosis is a type of cell division that is essential for sexual reproduction  
• It takes place in the reproductive organs and results in the formation of gametes with half the 
normal chromosome number  
• This is known as the haploid number  
• Meiosis halved the number of chromosomes so egg cells and sperms cells have 23 chromosomes 
each  
• The zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 from the mother’s egg cell and 23 from the father’s sperm  
• Meiosis occurs in sex organs in humans- the ovaries and testes 
• In flowering plants meiosis occurs in the anthers and in the ovules 
• In meiosis the daughter cells are not identical 
• They are genetically different and this contributes to genetic variation that provides the raw 
materials for selection and allows organisms to evolve in response to changing environments 
Differences between mitosis and meiosis  
Mitosis  
Meiosis  
One division  
Two divisions 
The number of chromosomes remains the same 
The number of chromosomes is halved 
The daughter cells are genetically identical 
The daughter cells are genetically different from 
the parent cells 
Two daughter cells are formed 
Four daughter cells are formed 
 
Inheritance and genes 
• Pedigree diagrams show how features are inherited in families  
• An allele is a version of a gene. Most genes have many alleles 

• The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism;  the phenotype is all the features of an 
organism other than its genotype 
• A dominant allele is always expressed in the phenotype  
• A recessive allele is only expressed when no dominant allele is present  
• A homozygous individual has two identical alleles of a gene and a heterozygous individual has 
two different alleles of a gene 
Monohybrid inheritance 
• Monohybrid inheritance involves the inheritance of a single characteristic such as plant height or 
flower color 
Codominance  
• Codominance occurs when both alleles are expressed in the phenotype as neither is dominant 
over the other

Sex Linkage 
Sex determination  
• All egg cells contain an X chromosome  
• Half the sperm cells contain an X chromosome and half contain a Y chromosome  
• At fertilization, the egg may fuse with either a sperm with an X chromosome or a sperm with a Y 
chromosome  
• Since there are equal numbers of sperm with the X chromosome and sperm with the Y chromosome, 
there is an equal chance of the zygote inheriting XX or XY and the child being female or male  
Sex inheritance  
• The Y chromosome is very small and much smaller than the X 
• Therefore the Y chromosome has fewer genes than the other chromosomes and far fewer than the 
X 
• One gene of the Y chromosomes stimulates the development of the testes in the embryo 
• If it is not present/mutated then the body that develops is female  
 
 

Sex Linkage  
• The genes that are located on the chromosomes are described as sex-linked even though they 
have nothing to do with determining gender or controlling sexual characteristics 
• Among the gens in the X chromosomes are genes involved with controlling vision and blood 
clotting  
• Males only have one copy of the genes that are on the X chromosomes, if any of them are recessive 
then the effect will be seen  
• Because women have two X chromosomes they are less affected by sex linked recessive alleles 
and this is why sex-linked conditions are more common in boys than in girls 
• Females are carries of sex linked disorders, such as red green color blindness",1599," Genetic characteristics are controlled by genes which are like coded instructions . Genes from one generation are transmitted to the next in the gametes . Human have between 20 000 to 25 000 different genes . DNA determines which enzymes are produced in each cell and therefore which chemical reaction takes place .  The ipient daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell . The zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 from the mother’s egg cell and 23 from sperm . Meiosis halved the number of chromosomes so egg cells and sperms cells have 23 chromosomes .

biology,Unit 18 Variation and selection,"Variation and selection 
Variation  
Types of variation 
• All humans have many features in common as we are all members of the same species 
• We have many features in common but there are significant differences which we use to 
categorize animals into different species 
• In biology, the term variation means: 
o Differences between species- we use them when constructing keys 
o Differences within species 
• There is considerable variation between individuals of the same species 
• Variation occurs in the feature we can see 
• Variation also occurs in features we cannot see which need specialist equipment to detect 
• For example, the different types of hemoglobin called phenotypic variation  
• Genetic variation is the differences between the genotypes of individuals. 
• There are two types of phenotypic variation within a species: 
o Continuous variation  
o Discontinuous variation  
Continuous variation  
• If a frequency histogram is plotted, it is likely that the mean height will be in the middle of the 
range and correspond to the group with the largest number of people 
• This type of distribution is called a normal distribution  
• This type of variation is called continuous variation 
• For example, there are many genes that contribute to your overall height 
• However, other factors such as quantity and quality of food you eat and the amount of exercise 
you take also influence your height 
• People also go through growth spurts at different ages that influence the results 
• Continuous variation also occurs in plants 
Discontinuous variation 
• Some people have attached earlobes, other people do not 
• This is called discontinuous variation  
• In this type of variation there is usually a small number of phenotypes and no intermediates 
• Discontinuous variation is caused by genes alone and the environment has no effect 
• The ABO blood group is another example  
• It is either A, B, AB or O 
• There are no intermediates 
• Some flowering plant species have flowers of distinctly different colors 
Inheritance versus the environment 
• Identical twins develop from the same embryo are genetically identical 
• However, they are different in many ways 

• These differences will have come about because they developed slightly differently in the womb 
and have been exposed to different environmental influences 
• Identical twins separated at birth, or shortly afterwards, and brought up apart often show 
striking similarities 
• These are often to do with personality, which shoes the influence that genes have on us 
• The effect of environmental factors can be investigated with plants  
• For example, the Mexican hat plant 
• You can detach these plants and grow them in pots and keep them under different conditions 
• Any variation shown will be because of environmental factors 
Mutations 
• A mutation is a change in a gene or chromosome that may cause a change in a phenotypic 
characteristic 
• A gene mutation is a change in the base sequence of DNA 
• Often the change can be harmful, but some mutations can be beneficial or have no effect at all 
Causes of mutation 
• Gene mutations are the only way in which new alleles are formed 
• They are caused by damage to DNA or by a failure in copying process that occurs before 
nuclear division 
• They occur naturally at random, but the rate at which they occur is increased by exposure to 
ionizing radiation and some chemicals 
• UV radiation, X-rays and Gamma rays are the most damaging  
• The greater the dose of radiation, the greater the chance of mutation  
• If mutation occur in body cells, they may affect the individual 
• Gene mutations are the cause of many human genetic diseases 
• Sickle cell anemia is an example 
• It is only mutation that occur in gamete-forming cells, or gametes themselves, are important in 
the long term 
• This is because these mutations can be inherited and provide new forms of variation  
Sickle cell anemia 
• These red blood cells are in the shape of a sickle 
• These cells have abnormal hemoglobin which makes it difficult for the red blood cells to carry 
oxygen 
• SCA can prove fatal if the distorted blood cells block blood vessels  
• Or if the spleen destroys the abnormal cells at a greater rate than red blood cells can be 
produced, causing anemia  
• SCA is a genetic disease resulting from a gene mutation  
• The normal allele, 𝐻𝑏𝐴 or 𝐻𝐴, codes for normal hemoglobin  
• The mutant allele, 𝐻𝑏𝑆 or 𝐻𝑆, codes for the abnormal form of hemoglobin  
• The two alleles are codominant  
• People who are heterozygous have both forms of hemoglobin in their red blood cells 
• Heterozygous who carry one SCA allele have a much milder form of the disease called a sickle 
cell trait 

• The possession of two SCA alleles puts a great selective disadvantage since the abnormal form 
of hemoglobin is not very good at transporting oxygen which causes several problems 
• The SCA allele is common among people from areas where malaria is common  
• This is because people who are heterozygous have both abnormal and normal forms of 
hemoglobin and do not usually have a problem with transport of oxygen 
• But they do have a resistance to malaria as the parasite that causes this disease cannot enter 
red blood cells 
• The link between SCA heterozygotes and resistance to malaria is an example of natural selection  
o There is a strong selection pressure against people who are homozygous for sickle cell 
anemia, 𝐻𝑆𝐻𝑆, because they could die of anemia 
o There is a strong selection pressure against people homozygous for the normal allele, 𝐻𝐴𝐻𝐴, 
because they could die from malaria 
• In areas where malaria is common, there is a strong selective advantage for heterozygous 
individuals, 𝐻𝐴𝐻𝑆, since they do not suffer badly from anemia and they are protected from 
anemia 
• So the sickle cell allele remains in the population in areas where malaria is an important 
selective agent 
Adaptive features 
• An adaptive feature is an inherited feature that helps an organism to survive and reproduce in 
its environment 
• Adaptive features are behavioral as well as structural 
• Adaptive features are likely to increase an individual’s fitness which refers to its chances of 
surviving in its environment, reproducing and having offspring  
Pond plants 
• Hydrophytes are plants that grow submerged or partially submerged in water 
• Buoyed up by water, with no need for water transport, floating plants save energy since they 
produce little or no xylem tissue 
• Roots, if present are for anchorage as there is no need to absorb water and mineral// no root 
hair cells 
• The leaves and stems of hydrophytes have little or no cuticle since there is no need to conserve 
eater 
• The problem with hydrophytes is that carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis diffuses slower 
through water than air 
• The same applies for oxygen since it is not soluble in water 
• Many hydrophytes have an extensive system of air spaces in their stems and leaves which allow 
gases to diffuse through quickly 
• These air spaces provide buoyancy to keep the plants close to the light 
• They are reservoirs of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
Desert adaptations 
• All plants have to balance water uptake and loss 
• It is important that they maintain the turgor in their cells, or they will wilt 
• Very high rates of transpiration can kill a plant if it cannot absorb enough water to prevent long-
term wilting 

• Xerophytes are plants that exist in conditions where water is scarce 
• Cacti are xerophytes that survive in hot, dry, arid and desert regions  
• Cacti reduce water loss and conserve water in the following ways: 
o Their leaves are reduced to spines, reducing the surface area over which water can be 
lost 
o A thick, waxy cuticle covers the plants surface and reduces transpiration  
o They have swollen stems containing water-storage tissue 
o They have a shallow, spreading root system to quickly absorb any water from rain and 
overnight condensation  
o Many cacti have a round, compact shape which reduces surface area over which water 
can be lost 
o They have shiny surfaces which reflect heat and light  
o Their stomata are closed during the day to reduce water loss 
Natural Selection 
• Natural selection is the process by which organisms are well adapted to their environment have 
a greater chance to breed and pass on their alleles to the next generation that those that are less 
well adapted  
Variation within populations 
• Variation is the term used to describe all the differences that exist within populations of 
organisms 
• Gene mutation is the only way in which completely new genetic material is produced 
• Some mutation may give an advantage to the individual that expresses them  
• Variation is also produced by sexual reproduction between two individuals 
• During meiosis, the alleles of different genes are shuffled to give new combination in the gametes 
• At fertilization, when the gametes fuse, alleles from two different individuals are combined within 
the same nucleus 
• Gene mutation, meiosis and fertilization give rise to variation between individuals in every 
generation  
Competition for resources 
• Among the organisms that survive the early stages of life there is competition for resources 
• Plants compete for space, light, water and nutrients 
• Animals compete for food, water, territories and mates 
• This is known as the struggle for existence or struggle for survival 
• Competition is fiercer between individuals of the same species 
• This is due to the fact that they have the same adaptive features to obtain their resources from 
the environment 
• Individuals in different species also competed but the competition is not as fierce 
Reproduction  
• The individuals with features that adapt them to the conditions in the environment are those most 
likely to survive and reproduce 
• Individuals that are not so well adapted are likely to lose out in the competition for resources 

• They may die before they have a chance to reproduce, or if they do reproduce, they have few 
offspring  
• The better adapted individuals have a greater chance to pass on their alleles to the next 
generation  
Natural selection 
• If the environment does not change, then natural selection maintains populations of organisms 
so they do not change much, as many are already well adapted to their environment  
• Natural selection will bring about a change in species over time 
• Thus selection is the mechanism by which evolution occurs 
• Evolution is a process of adaptation whereby population become more suited to their 
environment over generations 
Antibiotic resistance 
• Antibiotics are chemicals that kill bacteria or inhibit their growth  
• When bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic they are killed 
• However some individual bacteria that have a mutation may have resistance to an antibiotic  
• The bacteria may be able to produce an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic 
• These individual bacteria survive and now have more resources available as all their 
competitors- the non-resistant bacteria, have died 
• The resistance bacteria survive to reproduce and pass on this gene to their offspring 
• This is an example of natural selection  
• Humans have been responsible for the change in environment by introducing antibiotics 
• But we have not consciously chosen the bacteria which are resistant to antibiotics 
Selective breeding  
• Domesticated plants and animals have changed considerably over time due to artificial selection 
• These changes have happened in this way: 
o Humans choose a desirable feature or features of an animal or plant to improve 
o Animals or plants showing these features are bred to produce the next generation 
o The offspring are checked to find those that show an improvement in the desired feature 
or features. These are kept for breeding the next generation 
o This process of selective breeding continues for many generations 
• Selective breeding (artificial selection) involves humans finding organisms with desirable 
features, crossing them and selecting the best from the next generation  
• Commercial farmers want to increase the yields of their crops and animals 
• They want to improve features of economic importance to maximize their profits 
• This is called artificial selection as it is humans who are the selective agent not the environment 
• The danger of selective breeding is that there may be too much inbreeding between closely 
related individuals 
• This may result in harmful recessive alleles being passed on to the descendants and a reduction 
in vegetation 
 
 

Differences between artificial selection and natural selection  
Artificial selection 
Natural selection 
Selection due to human influences 
Selection due to environmental factors 
Produces varieties of organisms very different 
from native generations 
Produces greater biodiversity 
Does not result in new species 
May result in new species 
Inbreeding is common, leading to loss of vigor in 
the offspring 
Outbreeding is common, leading to hybrid vigor 
A relatively fast process 
A slow process, taking many years 
Proportion of heterozygous individuals in the 
population is reduced 
Proportion of heterozygous individuals in the 
population remains high 
 
There are two main methods of carrying out selective breeding: 
Outbreeding 
• Involves breeding of unrelated animals or plants 
• This may be used to combine the good characteristics of separate individuals 
• Outbreeding often results in tougher individuals with a better chance of survival 
• This is called hybrid vigor 
Inbreeding 
• Involves breeding close relative in an attempt to retain desirable characteristics 
• There can be harmful effects as a result of inbreeding  
• This can include loss of vigor, with the population weakened by a lack of gene diversity and 
reduced fertility 
• There is also a greater susceptibility to disease",2296," Variation and selection  variation occurs in biology . The term variation means: Differences between species- we use them when constructing keys . There is considerable variation between individuals of the same species . Genetic variation is the differences between genotypes of individuals .  There are two types of phenotypic variation within a species: continuous variation and discontinuous variation . Genetic variation is caused by genes alone and the environment has no effect . Genetic mutations are the only way in which new alleles are formed . They are caused by damage to DNA or by failure in copying process .  Selective breeding involves humans finding organisms with desirable features, crossing them and selecting the best from the next generation . Commercial farmers want to increase yields of crops and animals to maximize their profits . The danger of selective breeding is that there may be too much inbreeding between closely related individuals .",Hard

Energy flow 
• The sun is a principal source of energy input into biological systems 
• Light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic organisms and made available to all other 
organisms as chemical energy  
• Energy transfer occurs when animals feed on plants and when animals feed on other animals 
• Eventually the energy is transferred to the environment as heat and is lost 
• Nutrients consist of chemical elements that make up living organisms 
• They are taken up by plants, passed on to animals and eventually recycled back inti biological 
systems 
• This is known as nutrient cycling, since they are constantly reused  
Communities 
• Producers make their own organic nutrients from simple raw materials, such as carbon dioxide 
and water 
• Green plants use light as a source of energy to make sugars from carbon dioxide and water by 
photosynthesis 
• Some bacteria are also producers as they are photosynthetic or obtain their energy from simple 
chemical reactions 
• Some bacteria involved in recycling nitrogen obtain their energy from reactions involving 
nitrogen 
• Producers make energy available for all the other members of the community in the form of 
energy-rich carbon compounds (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) 
• Sunlight is the ultimate source of energy for almost all food chains 
• The major exception are the vent communities in the deep ocean that rely on chemical energy 
rather than sunlight energy 
• Consumers obtain their energy by eating other organisms, either plants or animals or both 
• They cannot make their own food, so they have to consume it 
• Herbivores are primary consumers as they eat the producers 
•  Carnivores are secondary consumers as they eat herbivores 
• Tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores, called top carnivores 
• Decomposer are fungi and bacteria that gain their energy from waste organic material 
• Each of these feeding groups is a trophic level 
Food Chains 
• Food chains show what living organism feed on in a community  
• They show the flow of energy from one organism to the next 
• The arrows show the direction in which energy in food is transferred from one organism to the 
next 
• Food chains not only show the flow of food, they also show the flow of energy 
• Producers gain their energy from the sun, so an energy chain would look like this: 
𝑆𝑢𝑛→𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑠→𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑠→𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑠 
• We don’t include the sun in food chains as it is not a food 
• Food chains start with producers 

• Energy flows to decomposers but they are rarely included in these simple food chains 
Food Webs 
• Animals will eat more than one type of living organism  
• A food web gives a more complicated picture of feeding relationships in an ecosystem  
• The over-harvesting of food species by humans in an unsustainable manner can result in a 
decrease in their numbers and extinction  
• Also the introduction of foreign species can displace native organisms due to predation and 
competition for resources 
• These disrupt food chains and food webs due to the removal of a species or a decrease in their 
numbers 
Pyramids of numbers and biomass 
Pyramids of numbers 
• Pyramids of numbers show how many individuals there are at each trophic level but give no 
indication of their size  
Pyramids of biomass 
• Pyramids of biomass indicate the mass of living material at each trophic level, but give no 
indication of the rate of growth  
• Biomass is the mass of living material  
• A biomass pyramid shows the actual weight or mass of living things at each trophic level  
• To draw a biomass pyramid, the data first needs to be collected 
• A sample of the organisms from each trophic level is taken and weighed  
• The average mass of the sample is calculated  
• The average mass is then multiplied by the estimated number of organisms present in the 
community  
• Dry mass tells us how much useful biological material is present as carbohydrates, proteins, 
and fats as food for the organisms in the community  
• The data is usually expressed in grams per square meter 
• The dry mass recorded is taken at one instant in time  
• Biomass pyramids do not take into account how fast an organism grows 
• This means it is better to calculate the biomass produced over a period of time  
• Biomass can vary with the seasons  
Shortening the food chain 
The efficiency of energy transfer 
• The efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels can be seen by using energy pyramids 
• These show the energy transferred from one trophic level to the next 
• Energy is always lost as it passes from one trophic level to the next  
• Since only some of the energy is passed from one trophic level to the next an energy pyramid is 
never inverted 
• Its shape is not affected by the size of the organisms or how many of them there are since it 
simply looks at the energy has been passed on  

Energy Losses 
• Energy flows through ecosystems is relatively insufficient 
• At best plants absorb only 2-5% of the light energy that strikes their leaves 
• Much of this energy is not trapped in photosynthesis because it is reflected from the surface 
of the leaves, it passes straight through them or is green light which they cannot absorb 
• Plants use as much of the energy they trap in photosynthesis in their own respiration  
• As an energy process, respiration is about 40% efficient 
• Much of the plant’s biomass us lost to decomposers 
• About 10% of the energy tapped by the plant is available to secondary consumers 
•  Much of what they eat is not very edible or easy to digest 
• So primary consumers make available about 10% of what they have eaten to secondary 
consumers 
• At each trophic level, energy is lost as heat to the environment and consumers loses energy 
in their faeces to decomposers 
• Food chains on land are rarely more than four trophic levels  
• When farmers grow crops, all the energy in the grain is available to us primary consumers  
• Livestock farmers grow or buy their plant food to feed their animals  
• Animals use up most of the energy in their food 
•  This means that there is not as much energy available to us 
• A vegetarian diet can support more people 
• This is because we are cutting down the 90% wastage of energy that occurs between each 
trophic level  
• People in many countries tend to have diets that mainly consist of food of plant origin or 
some meat or fish 
• The human population is increasing  
• If farmers are to provide enough food for everyone, our diet may change to one that includes 
more plant matter and less animal matter 
Nutrient cycles 
Nutrient cycling 
• Most living matter (95%) is made up of six elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
phosphorus and sulfur 
• Living things must have a constant supply of these elements if they are to make proteins, 
carbohydrates, fats and other organic materials 
• There is a finite source of these nutrients 
• Bacteria and fungi feed on dead and decaying matter 
•  They also feed on the waste matter of animals (urine and faeces) 
• They feed by breaking down carbohydrates, fats and proteins into small molecules that they can 
absorb 
• Many of these are respired 
• To do this they require water and a warm temperature as the process of digestion and 
respiration are catalysed by enzymes 
• They also need oxygen for aerobic respiration  
• Decomposers release carbon as carbon diocese when they respire 

• They also break down amino acids releasing ammonia into their surroundings  
• In thus way they recycle carbon and nitrogen  
• Single compounds are absorbed by plants and concerted into complex compounds 
• These nutrients are then passed in to animals when they eat the plants  
• We say that nutrients are cycled 
The carbon cycle 
• Carbon is used to make carbohydrates, proteins, fats, DNA and other important biological 
molecules 
• The carbon comes from carbon dioxide in the air 
• Plants also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it in photosynthesis to make 
food 
• Animals get the carbon compound by eating plants 
• Carbon dioxide gets into the air in the following ways: 
o Plants and animals use some of their food for respiration, releasing carbon dioxide 
o Decomposer use dead plants and animals for food. They also use some of the decaying 
material for respiration, releasing carbon dioxide 
o  Fossil fuels and natural gas contain carbon. Carbon dioxide is one of the gases released 
in the air during combustion when these fuels are burnt  
• These processes release carbon dioxide in the air and balances the uptake from photosynthesis 
so the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere remains constant  
• Sometimes, dead plants and animals do not decompose 
• Their dead bodies become fossilised to form coal and gas-fossil fuels 
The water cycle 
• The water cycle demonstrates how important water is to life on earth 
The nitrogen cycle 
• Nitrogen is an element required for many biologically important molecules 
• Amino acids, proteins, DNA and chlorophyll contain nitrogen  
• Approximately 80% of the air is nitrogen gas  
• It is not useful to many organisms in this form 
• It has to be made available to them in the form of compounds such as amino acids and proteins, 
and ions such as nitrate and ammonium ions  
• Most of the nitrogen that plants absorb is in the form of nitrate ions 
• They use the amino acids in their leaves 
•  The amino acids are used to form proteins such as enzymes 
• Animals eat plants and so obtain their nitrogen in the form of plant protein  
• Any excess amino acid are broken down to ammonia by deamination 
• Animals that live on land convert the ammonia to urea and excrete it in urine  
Decomposers 
• Break down dead remains and animal waste releasing ammonium ions 
• Bacteria also break down urea in urine to ammonium ions (deamination) 
 

Nitrifying bacteria 
• Change ammonium ions to nitrate ions 
• Bacteria gain their source of energy from the oxidation reaction  
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
• Convert nitrogen gas from the air into compounds of nitrogen that they use themselves 
• When they die this nitrogen ions available to plants 
• Nitrogen fixing bacteria is found is some legumes (peas, beans, alfalfa) 
• The bacteria are inside swellings on the roots called root nodules 
• These bacteria change nitrogen gas into ammonia that the legume plants use to male amino 
acids 
• In return, the legumes provide a stable environment for the bacteria 
•  Nitrogen fixation requires a lot of energy  
Denitrifying bacteria 
• Live in water logged soil  
• Change nitrate ions to nitrogen gas 
• They balance the uptake of nitrogen gas by nitrogen fixing bacteria 
Lightning 
• Causes nitrogen and oxygen to react together at high temperatures 
• Nitrogen oxides are formed in these reactions 
• Nitrate ions are lost from the soil before plants can absorb them as they are washed out by water 
(leaching) 
• Farmers add fertilisers containing nitrogen to the soil  
• This provides material that enters the nitrogen cycle at the point where decomposers act 
Populations, communities and ecosystems 
Population growth 
• A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same habitat at the same 
time  
• All the individuals in a population may interbreed 
• Sometimes it is difficult to tell the geographical limits of a population  
• Some species are widely distributed and it is difficult to divide them into separate populations 
• However, there are usually barriers to reproduction such as rivers and mountains that divide 
them into separate populations 
• Some individuals migrate across these barriers, so there in interbreeding between populations  
• A community includes all the populations of different species in an ecosystem 
• An ecosystem is a unit containing the community of organisms and their environment  
• An ecosystem is made up of the biotic component (the community) and the abiotic component 
(physical factors: light, water, pH and temperature) 
 
 

Population size 
• The number of births adds to the population and the number of deaths decreases it  
• Individuals may enter or leave a population from neighbouring populations  
• Animals migrate so there is mixing between populations 
• Plant use seed dispersal to colonise new areas in this way individuals leave one population of 
plants to enter another  
• The main factors that affect the rate of population growth is food, predation and diseases 
• An organism that enter a new habitat may show the lag, exponential and stationary phases if 
there is plenty food, no predation and diseases 
• Competition for resources: plants compete for light, space, water and soil nutrients. Animals 
compete for food, space and mates 
• Predation: predators often take young, sick individuals or less well-adapted individuals. 
Predators may limit the growth of a population of prey animals. But it more often that the 
population of prey animals limits the population size of the predator  
• Disease: pathogens are transmitted more easily when organisms live close together  
The growth of a population: bacteria 
• A small number of bacteria are placed into a flask with a warm nutrient solution which is aerated 
so the bacteria may respire aerobically  
• Bacteria grow and divide under these conditions  
• Some species of bacteria divide every 20 minutes if conditions are ideal  
Phases of bacterial growth 
1. The lag phases, when doubling of the numbers has little effect as the numbers are so small. 
Bacteria take up water and nutrients and make new cytoplasm, DNA and enzymes 
2. The exponential or log phase when the population is increasing rapidly. The population 
increases by doubling and there are no limiting factors. After a while, lack of food and build-up 
of waste limits the population growth which slows down and stops 
3. The stationary phase, when bacteria cells are dying at the same rate at which they are being 
produced. This may be because of shortage of food or because waste products are building up  
4. The death phase, when more cells are dying than being produced so the population declines, 
causes of death may be lack of food, shortage of oxygen or a build-up of toxic waste products. 
The curve is known as a sigmoid growth curve 
• Some species show this population in the wild 
• When resources become available, species that can reproduce rapidly grow exponentially  
• When the resources are used up, most of them die 
• Most species do not do this, they remain fairly stable over time  
Human population  
Human population growth 
• Lack of food and shelter together with the effects of malnutrition, diseases and wars meant that 
mortality rates were high and people did not live long  
• The human population has increases exponentially over the past 300 years for the following 
reasons: 

o Improved agriculture means that most people are better fed. Better nutrition means they 
are better defended against diseases, especially those caused by malnutrition  
o Public health has improved. There are clean water supplies, drainage of waste and 
sewage treatment. This has decreased epidemics of waterborne diseases such as cholera 
o  Medical care has improved. People are also vaccinated against many infectious diseases 
• The effects of these improvements have been: 
o Decrease in the infant and child mortality rates 
o Decrease in death rates from starvation and malnutrition  
o Increase in life expectancy  
• In spite of these improvements there are huge inequalities in food, housing, water and health 
services 
• Many of the world’s human population live in poverty with high infant and child mortality rates 
Controlling human population growth 
• There are still controls on population increase 
• Famine, epidemics, floods, wars, tsunamis and other disasters lead to loss of life 
• The earth has limited resources and limited space and the population will have to stabilise and 
even decrease at some time in the future 
•  The most obvious way to do this is to reduce the birth rate 
• Many groups of people have strongly held religious or moral views on birth control and family 
size 
• This means they often have large families 
• The rate of increase in population is most influenced by the proportion of child bearing women 
in the population 
• Increasing the human population size brings greater demands on resources and problems for 
the environment such as the supply of housing, food, transport and energy needs 
• There is also the problem of how to dispose of our rubbish",2810," The sun is a principal source of energy input into biological systems .

Cell Organelles 
Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum 
• Rough ER is a complex system of double membranes.  
• They contain fluid filled spaces between the membranes which allow materials to be transported 
throughout the cell.  
• Where ribosomes are present on the outer surface, the membranes are called Rough ER. 
•  The main function of Rough ER is to package and transport proteins made by the ribosomes.  
• Cells in the alimentary canal have large amounts of ER

The use of microorganisms and biotechnology 
• Biotechnology is the use of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to make useful products 
or carry out services for us.  
• The use of both bacteria and fungi are in various processes is widespread 
o Bacteria reproduce very quickly with a generation time of less than 30 minutes 
o Unlike animals and plants, microbes can convert raw materials into the finished product 
very quickly  
o The use of bacteria means that food production can ne independent of climate 
o Bacteria can produce complex proteins that pass out into the surrounding medium and 
can be harvested. Enzymes made by microorganisms are used in the food industry  
• Examples of enzymes that are produced by bacteria for use in the food industry are: 
o Amylase for breaking down starch in the production of glucose syrup  
o Pectinase for extracting juice from fruit 
o Sucrose for breaking down sucrose in making confectionery  
o Protease for making meat more tender 
• With the aid of genetic engineering, scientists can quickly alter microbes and so modify products 
• Breeding new varieties of plants and animals can take a long time 
• Plasmids in bacteria are easy to work with, since they replicate very quickly 
• Plasmids can be cut open by enzymes and a gene from another organisms can be spliced into 
them  
• In nutrient media, bacteria multiply rapidly, making many copies of the plasmid and the inserted 
gene 
• The use of bacteria and fungi in the manufacture of complex chemicals raises some ethical 
concerns over their manipulation and growth  
Biofuels and bread making  
• Many microbes can respire successfully without oxygen  
• Yeasts can respire with or without oxygen  
• When yeast respires without oxygen (anaerobically) it is called fermentation

Biofuels 
• Biofuels are fuels made from biological materials 
• The raw materials often used is sugar cane juice which contains a lot of carbohydrates 
• Glucose from maize starch is another raw material 
• This is obtained by treating the starch with carbohydrase enzymes 
• Ethanol is a good substitute for petrol because it has a high energy content when burnt and 
does not produce toxic gases 
• Using ethanol as fuel means there is no overall increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
• As a result this fuel is carbon neutral 
• Car engines need to be modified to be able to use pure ethanol  
• Oil seed rape is a crop that provides oil that is converted into fuel called biodiesel  
 

Bread making 
• Baking is another example of using yeast to produce a food 
• Bread is made from dough 
• This mixture is kept at a warm temperature 
• The yeast starts to ferment the sugar, producing carbon dioxide gas and alcohol 
• Bubbles of carbon dioxide are trapped inside the dough and make it rise 
• When the bread is baked in a hot oven the bubbles of the gas make the bread light in texture 
• The heat causes the alcohol to evaporate leaving behind the traditional taste of bread ] 
Enzymes and biotechnology  
Biological washing powders 
Biological washing powders may contain one or more of the following enzymes: 
• Proteases to break down protein stains  
• Lipases to break down fats in grease stains 
• Amylases to break down starch 
• Celluloses to break down cellulose fibers on the outside of cotton fabric to remove the dirt 
attached to them  
• The enzymes have been modified so that they withstand the high temperatures and alkaline 
conditions  
• During a wash cycle, the enzymes break down the stains and the products of the reaction 
dissolve or are suspended in water and are removed when the washing machine is emptied  
Extracting fruit juices 
• Pectinases are enzymes that break down pectin 
• Pectins are molecules that act like glue in plant cell walls 
• Pectinases are used for extracting fruit juices and for softening vegetables 
The use of lactase in making lactose-free milk  
• Some people do not produce enough lactase and therefore have problems digesting lactose 
• They may get diarrhea, wind or stomach cramps if they consume lactose products 
• Lactose is a complex sugar, similar to sucrose that can be broken down into simple sugars by 
lactase 
Fermenters 
Industrial production of penicillin  
• One important use of large-scale industrial fermentation is the production of antibodies such as 
penicillin  
• The fermenter is inoculated with a culture of suitable fungus  
• Then fermentation is carried out under certain conditions that have to be maintained inside the 
fermenter  
• These conditions should include: 
o Adding nutrients, such as sugar or starch as a source of carbon for respiration 
o Ammonia or urea is added as a source of nitrogen to make proteins 

o Vitamin B complex is added for respiration  
o Maintaining a constant temperature of about 30°C 
o Maintaining a constant pH of about 6.5  
Batch Culture 
• It takes about 30 hours for penicillin production to start 
• Penicillin is secreted into the surrounding liquid by fungus 
• This is because penicillin is a secondary metabolite, a substance which is not necessary for the 
growth of fungus 
• Penicillin production starts after the exponential growth phase in response to one or more 
limiting factors 
• After about 6 days, the mixture in the fermenter is filtered, the penicillin is extracted using a 
solvent and then purified into a crystalline salt  
• This type of production is known as batch culture 
• After the 6 day period, the fermenter is emptied, cleaned and sterilized ready for the next batch 
Industrial fermentation 
• Industrial fermenters are large tanks that can hold as much as 500 000 𝑑𝑚3 of fermenting 
mixture 
• Conditions inside these huge tanks are carefully controlled 
• How fermenters work: 
o The fermentation vessel is made of stainless steel and is filled with a medium containing 
the required nutrients. These include sugars and ammonium salts. Some of the fungus is 
added 
o The fungus grows well in the conditions in the fermenter. Sugars provide energy for 
respiration and ammonium salts are used by the fungus to make proteins and nucleic 
acid. After a few days, the fungus starts to produce penicillin, which accumulates in the 
fermenter 
o A stirrer keeps the microorganisms suspended so they always have access to nutrients 
and oxygen. Stirring also helps to maintain an even temperature throughout the fermenter 
o An air supply provides oxygen for the aerobic respiration of the fungus 
o A water-cooled jacket removed the heat produced by fermentation to give a constant 
temperature of 24°c 
o Probes monitor the temperature and make sure the pH is constant at 6.5 by adding alkalis 
if necessary 
Genetic engineering  
• Genetic engineering involves changing the genetic material of an organism by removing, 
changing or inserting individual genes 
• A gene is a section of DNA that codes for the production of a specific protein  
• Genetic engineering is the transfer of a gene from the DNA of one species to the DNA of another 
species 
•  This is a process that can never be achieved by artificial selection because only in rare species 
would one species breed with another 
• Genetic engineering allows the transfer of genes between totally unrelated species 

Examples of genetic engineering  
Human medicines 
• Insulin, human growth hormones and blood clotting agents are produced by bacteria that have 
been genetically modified with the appropriate human genes 
• These proteins are mass produced and used as medicines 
Herbicide resistance in crop plants 
• Genetically modified variety of rape seed has been developed in which a gene is transferred into 
it from a soil bacterium  
• This gene makes oilseed rape resistant to the herbicide glufosinate 
• When applied to fields of oilseed rape this herbicide would not only kill the weeds but the crop 
itself 
• But the GM oilseed rape is not affected by the herbicide and so continues to grow while only the 
weed is destroyed 
Insect resistance in crop plants 
• Maize and cotton can be attacked by insects which reduce their yields 
• The major pests of maize are root worm larvae and stem-boring caterpillars 
• The genetically modified plants produce their own toxin which kills insect larvae that feed on it 
• This has less environmental impact than sprayed pesticides, because only the insects feeding on 
the crop plants are killed 
Additional vitamins in crop plants 
• GM varieties of rice have been developed by transferring genes from maize and a soil bacterium, 
that enables people to make vitamin A 
• The resultant rice is a pale yellow in color giving its name, Golden Rice 
• If, or when, this rice becomes available to grow on a large scale it will improve the diets if the 
people who eat it  
• They will be able to make vitamin A 
• This will reduce the high mortality rates as a result of poor immune systems  
Industrial production on insulin  
• Genetic engineering makes it possible to make insulin quickly and cheaply on a large scale  
• The human gene that codes for the production of insulin is identified 
• Restriction enzymes act as chemical scissors to cut the human insulin-making gene from the rest 
of DNA 
• A circular piece of DNA called a plasmid is removed from a bacterium 
• The same restriction enzymes are then used to cut open the plasmid 
• The two ends of the DNA of the insulin-making gene are an exact match with the two DNA ends 
and the plasmid 
• These are called sticky ends 
• Another enzyme called ligase is used to attach the sticky ends of the insulin-making gene to the 
sticky ends and plasmid 
• The plasmid is now known as a recombinant plasmid as is inserted back into the bacteria 

• The bacteria now has the gene code for insulin  
• The bacteria multiply very rapidly inside an industrial fermenter and produce insulin  
Advantages and disadvantages of genetically modified crops 
Benefits: 
• Solving global hunger- GM could feed more people as the crops that are produced are able to 
tolerate extreme climate conditions and soils. Food production could be increased in marginal 
areas 
• Environmentally friendly- GM crops can be resistant to insects, weeds and diseases so there will 
be less use of pesticides. Also genes that improve nitrogen uptake would mean less need for 
chemical fertilizers and lessen the environmental threat they pose 
• Consumer benefits- GM crops have already been produced with improved flavor and better 
keeping qualities. They are easier to produce and require less additives 
Concerns: 
• Environmental safety- There are concerns that new GM plants will become successful weeds. 
Pollen from GM crops are resistant to weed killers and may be transferred to other plants by 
insects or the wind 
• Food safety- new gene combinations may have effects that are so far unknown, they result in 
harmful substances being produced 
• Biodiversity- increasing use of herbicides and plant breeding will reduce the number of plant 
varieties and wild varieties",1854," Microorganisms and biotechnology is the use of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi to make useful products .

Food Supply 
Increased food production 
• Modern technology has improved food supplies in many parts of the world 
• Arable farms use large agricultural machines to work very large fields 
• Chemical fertilizers encourage the growth of crops 
• Pesticides kill pests  
• Herbicides kill weeds that compete with the plant for resources 
• Selective breeding has increased yield and made crops more resistant to drought and disease 
• Genetic engineering has transferred features to crops from unrelated species 
• Intensive farming is using modern technology to achieve high yields of crop plants and livestock 
• This involves growing crop plants over large areas at high densities and keeping livestock in 
large numbers 
• In many intensive systems, animals are reared indoors in large numbers 
• Intensive methods have negative effects on the environment  
• Cattle produce methane which is a greenhouse gas 
• Urine and faeces pollute lakes, waterways and seas where it can cause eutrophication 
• The waste from animal farms can have serious effects on surroundings 
• High densities of animals means that parasites and pathogens can spread easily 
• This means using pesticides and antibiotics to treat animals and this could cause resistance to 
those chemicals 
• A monoculture is growing the same crop on large areas, year after year 
• This has an advantage of allowing farmers to concentrate on growing large quantities of a crop 
• This also has negative effects on the environment  
• Herbicides and pesticides kill harmless plant and insect species that may even help the plant  
• Continuous us of these chemicals act as selective agents, resulting in the evolution of pests, 
weeds and pathogens 
• The large scale use of chemical fertilizers can reduce the structure of the soil  
• Reduces biodiversity of soil organisms that support crop growth 
• The addition of organic mature, such as manure helps to maintain a good soil structure 
World Food Supply 
• As the world population increased, farmers ability to produce enough food increased] 
• There is enough food to feed everyone, but many people die of starvation and malnutrition  
• Shortage of food is caused by politics, economics, wars and poverty  
• Many poorer countries produce enough food to feed their population but have to sell food or 
grow non-food cash-crops to gain foreign currencies 
• Drought, flooding, pests and diseases may cause crops to fail  
• Famine is most often caused by failure to supply food to those at risk of starvation 
• Often there are problems transporting food to places where there is famine  
Social, environmental and economic implications 
• Food production requires large areas of land 

• This has meant that groups of people have been displaced, sometimes forcibly  
• Land clearance for plantations and ranching has resulted in environmental damage 
• As farming has become increasingly mechanized, there is not enough employment available 
• This has driven people away from rural areas to cities for employment  
• Intensive agriculture requires large input of energy from burning fossil fuels 
• It also requires much investment by large corporations intent on profit making  
Habitat destruction 
Reasons for habitat destruction  
• The clearance of land for crop production and for the production of biofuels 
• Space to build units for livestock production and cattle rearing  
• Digging mine and quarries for the extraction of coal and mineral ores, such as iron ore and 
bauxite 
• More people require more housing and associated infrastructure 
• Space for long-term storage of waste and recycling of it 
• Marine pollution. Major pollutants of the sea include fertilizers, which are thought to cause algal 
bloom in the sea, oil from oil wells and ships and industrial chemicals  
Human influences on food chains and webs 
• Killing of large predators- humans have killed many of these because they are dangerous 
• Killing of large herbivores for food- there were many different species of these in large numbers 
• Overfishing  
• Removing species results in unbalanced food webs and unbalanced ecosystems that are further 
at risk of damage and other factors 
• Top predators control the population of primary consumers 
• Their removal means that population of herbivorous animals increases and so there is increased 
competition for the plant food that they eat 
• The effect can be overgrazing and habitat destruction  
Deforestation  
• Humans have cleared forests to grow food, to provide space and transport links  
• There are now very few forests left 
• Deforestation has resulted in a number of environmental problems: 
o The extinction of species 
o The loss of soil  
o An increase in flooding  
o The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
• When vegetation is removed from tropical forests, the soil is easily washed away causing 
erosion, formation of gullies and loss of plant nutrients 
• The land is rapidly degraded after all tress are cut down  
• Local weather patterns change with more frequent and severe storms 
• Flooding happens more frequently as water runs off the land and is not absorbed and transpired 
by plants 
• Forests act as stores of water, their leaves slow down the rate of evaporation and decrease the 
rate at which water reaches the soil 

• Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere when vegetation in burnt  
• There is increased decomposition that also releases more carbine dioxide which is not absorbed 
by plants  
• Rainforests have no effect on maintaining the correct balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in 
our atmosphere  
• They produce about as much carbon dioxide as they use in photosynthesis 
• There is no evidence that rainforest are the lungs of the earth  
• Destruction of rainforests means the loss of many habitats and the extinction of many species 
• There are many species in rainforests that are yet to be discovered and classified 
Pollution 
• Pollution is the harm done to the environment by the release of substances produced by human 
activities

Waste Plastics 
• Biodegradable materials are those when thrown away can be broken down in the environment by 
decomposers 
• Some materials are unable to be broken down and are known as non-biodegradable  
• Plastics are used for packaging because they last a long time and do not decay easily  
• This becomes a problem when it comes to disposing of plastics 
• Most plastic wastes go into landfills where they take up a lot of space 

• Biodegradable plastics are designed to break down more quickly that non-biodegradable 
conventional ones 
• We can recycle many thermoplastics by melting and molding them into new shapes 
• Burning plastics in incinerators reduces volumes of waste but produces toxic gases when they 
burn 
• Non-biodegradable plastics pose a threat to aquatic life too  
• Animals can swallow plastic bags mistaken for food 
• Aquatic animals can become entangled in discarded plastic wastes and other forms of plastic  
Water pollution  
Pollution of rivers and seas 
Rivers empty toxic waste into the sea, resulting in the following: 
• Fertilizers and sewage encourage the growth of algae that release toxins 
• Pesticides are concentrated in the tissues of some mollusks  
• Radioactive chemicals are found in higher concentration around coastal nuclear power stations 
• Toxic metals, such as mercury, copper and lead are found in tissues of marine organisms 
• Sewage is the biggest single pollutant 
• It encourages the growth of algae and bacteria which use up a lot of oxygen killing fish and small 
invertebrates 
• If raw untreated sewage is dumped in a river it encourages the growth of bacteria that feed on 
organic matter 
• As water travels downstream, the water gradually improves as suspended waste settle out and 
are decomposed by bacteria  
• If no more sewage is dumped in the river, the community recover as the oxygen concentration of 
the water increases 
•  In many countries sewage is treated so that raw sewage is not deposited into rivers 
• Fertilizers drain from the land into rivers and lakes  
• Problems occur if a farmer uses too much fertilizer of if the fertilizer is added at the wrong time  
Eutrophication 
• Water is enriched with plant nutrients 
• This is the sequence of events: 
o Fertilizer can be washed through the soil into rivers and streams- this is called 
leaching. The rivers may flow into a lake 
o Once in the water, this stimulates population growth of algae. Nutrients in the 
fertilizers are usually low in concentration in the water and so limit the growth of 
algae 
o Animals that eat the algae do not multiply fast enough to control their growth 
o Algae cover the surface layers of water, reducing the light reaching plants at the 
bottom of the lake 
o These plants eventually die and rot on the river bed 
o Algae also die as there is competition for resourced and many are shaded by the 
algae on the surface 
o Decomposers, such as bacteria, feed on dead plants and algae 
o Bacteria respire aerobically, multiply rapidly and use up the dissolved oxygen  

o The concentration of oxygen decreases and this kills fish and invertebrates that 
cannot respire properly 
• 
The same chain of events occurs if sewage gets into waterways 
• 
Bacteria multiply quickly and use up the oxygen available  
• 
The problems of eutrophication are caused by nitrate and phosphate 
• 
These ions are in short supply in most aquatic ecosystems 
• 
So they are the limiting factors to the growth of plants 
• 
When they are added in the form of fertilisers, plant growth increases 
• 
Farmers are encouraged to add appropriate amounts of fertilisers at appropriate times 
• 
Removing phosphate from detergents has reduced the amount of phosphate in the soil 
• 
Nitrate in the sea causes the growth of algae, many of which produce toxins and kill other marine 
life 
The effects of contraceptive hormones 
• Many women take contraceptive pills containing oestrogen  
• The hormone is excreted in urine and is found in sewage 
• The active ingredient in contraceptive pills is synthetic oestrogen known as E22 
• Oestrogens are not broken down in all sewage treatment plants 
• They pass through unchanged into rivers and lakes 
• Male fish and amphibians respond to this oestrogen in water by gaining certain female 
characteristics (intersex) 
• This is also called feminisation 
• This involves producing eggs inside their testes 
• Having some female structures and making a protein found in egg yolk 
• In addition their sperm cells do not develop properly 
• An increase in oestrogens in drinking water has been linked to the decrease in sperm count in 
men  
• There are other sources of oestrogen in the environment 
• Many other synthetic chemicals have the same effect  
• These chemicals are in plastics in waste from the agriculture industry 
• E22 is removed from the waste water from some sewage works so the rest could be upgraded 
• The use of charcoal filters is one way of doing this  
• Upgrading sewage works and drinking water treatment works will be expensive 
The Greenhouse Effect 
Greenhouse gases 
• Some of the gases in the atmosphere act like a greenhouse to keep in heat 
• Greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide, water vapour and methane 
• Some man-made air pollutants such as CFCs also are also greenhouse gases 
• These greenhouse gases allow solar energy to pass through the earth’s surface 
• Some energy enters food chains and is eventually lost in the atmosphere as heat 
• This is radiated away from the earth’s surface 
• Some heat energy escapes into space but much is reflected back towards the earth  
• The greenhouse effect is a natural process which is essential to maintain suitable temperatures 
on earth  

• Power station, factories, domestic heating and transport using fossil fuels has released large 
amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
• After deforestation, roots and other remaining tree parts are decomposed by microbes in the 
soil, producing even more carbon dioxide 
• There has also been a significant increase in methane due to rice paddy fields and cattle rearing 
• Rotting material and the extraction of oil and natural gas are other sources of methane 
Climate Change 
• Human activities are causing an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases 
• The atmosphere is getting warmer 
• This is causing the enhanced greenhouse effect  
• There is a fear that this warming is increasing  
• If the temperature were to rise over 0°C then the polar ice would start to melt 
• This would cause a rise in sea level and flooding in many low lying area 
• This could also cause a change in wind patterns and the distribution of rainfall leading to more 
extreme weather 
• Some parts are expected to become very dry 
• This could lead to a reduction of grain crops 
• The pattern of the world’s food distribution could be affected with economic and political 
consequences 
• Measures to reduce the effect of climate change involve reducing carbon emissions 
• This may be done by utilising public transport, using energy efficiently, recycling and altering 
the diet of cattle so they produce less methane 
The Greenhouse Effect 
• Solar radiation passes through the atmosphere and warms the earth’s surface 
• The earth radiates heat energy back into space. This is mainly infra-red radiation  
• Some of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases 
• This causes the air to warm up 
Acid Rain  
• Sulfur dioxide is released when fossil fuels are burned 
• Together with nitrogen oxides from exhaust fumes, they cause acid rain  
• Rain is naturally acidic as the water dissolves carbon dioxide 
• When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide dissolve in water in the atmosphere and react with 
oxygen they produce sulfuric and nitric acid which lower the pH 
• These gases can be carried over large distances by winds before being deposited as dry 
particles or dissolved in the rain 
• When acid rain falls on tress it kills the leaves and reduces their resistance to disease 
• Vegetation is affected by high concentrations of sulfur dioxide 
• Some species of lichen are sensitive to sulfur dioxide and grow only where the air is free 
• Some are able to tolerate high conditions 
• Others can tolerate intermediate conditions 
• By looking at the species growing in area, you can deduce the average concentration of sulfur 
dioxide 

• When acid rain falls on soils on limestone or on chalk it has little effect 
• This is because the soils are alkaline and neutralizes the acid 
• When it falls on soils on hard rock such as granite, the soil is already acidic and there is nothing 
to neutralize the acid 
• Acid rain causes plant nutrients to become soluble and wash out of the soils leaving them 
infertile  
• Aluminum compounds in soil become soluble at a pH lower than 5.5 
• Acidified water that enters streams, lakes and rivers lowers the pH of these bodies 
• The aluminum concentration also increases considerable 
• Small invertebrates and fish cannot survive in such low pH conditions and aluminum ions are 
toxic 
• There is measures that prevent acid rain such as: 
o Low sulfur fuels could be used. Crushing coal and washing it with a solvent that dissolves 
the sulfur compounds reduces its sulfur content  
o Flue gas desulfurization removes the sulfur from power stations by treating the waste 
gases with wet powdered limestone, neutralizing the acidic gases before they can escape 
o Catalytic convertors can be fitted to reduce the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust fumes of 
cars 
Sustainable resources 
• A resource is any substance, organism or source of energy that we take from the environment  
• A sustainable resources is a resource which is renewed by the activities of organisms so that 
there is always enough to take from the environment without it running out  
• Nonrenewable resources are those which cannot be regenerated or reproduced. These 
resources cannot be replaced 
The need to conserve fossil fuels 
There are various ways to conserve fossil fuels for the future: 
• Use fossil fuels more efficiently by burning them to make full use of the energy released on 
combustion  
• Reduce wastage of energy 
• Reducing the demand for petrol/gasoline 
• Recycling materials 
• Alternatives to fossil fuels: wind energy, solar energy., hydro electrical power, nuclear power, 
burning rubbish and wood from fast growing willow tees  
Sustainable timber production 
• Timber is a valuable resource 
• As soon as the trees are felled, they are replanted 
• The replanting is an example of restocking so that resource can be harvested without depletion 
• Some governments manage forests by issuing permits to logging companies 
• They are given quotas so they do not take more trees than they can regrow  
 
 

Sustainable development  
• Certain areas of the sea are declared off limits for fishing during the breeding season  
• Quotas are issued by fishing authorities so that boats cannot take too many fish in each season  
• Fishing nets have to be a certain minimum size so certain small fish can escape and survive and 
breed 
• Some stocks of fish can be restocked if it is possible to breed them in captivity and raise them in 
hatcheries 
Sustainable development  
• Sustainable development aims to provide the needs of an increasing human population without 
harming the environment  
• Ssustainable development requires: – management of conflicting demands – planning and co-
operation at local, national and international levels   
Sewage treatment and recycling  
Sewage treatment  
There are three main stages in the treatment of sewage: 
• Primary treatment involves removing large solids by filters or screens. The grits and organic 
solids are allowed to settle out in large tanks 
• Secondary treatment involves microbes, mainly bacteria decomposing material suspended in 
water. This happens in two ways: 
o The activated sludge process in which air is pumped through the sewage with a 
community of bacteria, fungi and protoctists which respire in aerobic conditions and 
break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats to carbon dioxide. Urea is broken down to 
ammonia and then converted to nitrate ions 
o Trickle filters are beds of gravel covered with microbes, the liquid from the primary 
treatment is sprayed over these beds from large rotating arms. As the liquid trickles 
through the gravel, the microbes break down the organic matter 
• Tertiary treatment involves a period of settling. The liquid from the secondary process passes 
into large tanks. Here microbes and any remaining organic material settle out to form sludge. 
This sludge may be put back into the secondary stage to increase the population of 
microorganisms or it may go to an anaerobic stage in which bacteria break down waste matter to 
methane in anaerobic conditions. The methane is burned as a fuel in the sewage works to 
provide energy for operating the machinery. Sludge may also be dumped at sea or spread on the 
land as a soil conditioner 
• The water leaving the plant will be treated in a variety of ways to make it safe 
Recycling waste 
• Unless waste is handled and disposed of properly it may be hazardous 
• The solution is to recycle useful materials 
Endangered species 
• A species becomes extinct if there are no individuals left alive anywhere in the world 
• Some species are kept alive only in captivity and they are described as extinct in the world  

• When the numbers of a species decrease to such a level that it is at risk of becoming extinct the 
species is described as endangered 
• The reasons for species become endangered and extinct are: 
o Habitat destruction  
o Climate change  
o Pollution  
o Overfishing  
o Hunting for food and sport 
o Competition with species that humans have moved from one part of the world to another  
o Predation by introduced or alien species 
Threats to the survival of species 
• Climate change is occurring as a result of changes to the composition of the atmosphere 
• The world is growing warmer, plants and animals associated with tropical regions are extending 
their ranges away from the equator  
• Plants better able to survive in changing environments will outcompete other species 
• Deforestation is not the only cause of habitat loss 
• Wetlands are very important as they provide ecological services for us and also are feeding 
grounds for migrating birds 
• Many wetlands across the world have been drained to provide land for farming, housing, 
industrial and leisure activities 
•  Pollution is occurring on a global scale  
• Introduced species have been moved around the globe by humans 
• Sometimes we have done this deliberately by introducing animals for sport or to control pests 
• Hunting has caused the extinction of some species 
• They have been hunted for food, sport, trade and as a deliberate policy to remove dangerous 
animals and pests 
• Animals have been trapped and shot for their fur in the days before man-made material became 
available 
• In some places animals are shot as a deliberate policy to protect farmland 
• There is very little genetic variation in small population 
• This makes rare and endangered species at particular risk of becoming extinct 
• With few individuals alive, many of the alleles of the genes in that species are no longer left 
• This reduces the chances of the population evolving in response to changes in the environment 
Conservation 
• Endangered species have to be conserved 
•  Monitoring can involve labelling, radio tagging and counting flocks of bird and herds of animals  
• No species lives in isolation so we have a duty to conserve ecosystems and habitats. Here are 
some ways in which this is done: 
o National Park-s large tracts of land set aside for wildlife but which may be occupied by 
people who are patrolled by wardens 
o Marine parks to protect areas of the sea from damage by fishing and pollution  
o Growing endangered plants in botanical gardens and re-establishing them in the wild 
o Reducing habitat destruction 
o Re-establishment of ecosystems that have been degraded  

o Preventing the trade of endangered species 
o  Encouraging sustainable management of ecosystems. Trees removed from forests 
should be replaced by planting or allowing time for natural replacement of seeds 
o Seed banks are cold stores that conserve seeds of endangered or valuable species. Their 
genes may be useful for crop improvement in the future or to produce valuable products 
such as medicinal products. Seeds are collected from plants in the wild and are put into 
long term storage 
o Increasing people’s knowledge and understanding of the way in which their actions affect 
wildlife will help to ensure the success of conservation programmers 
Reasons for conservation 
• Ecosystems provide us with services such as treating waste, providing food and fuels and giving 
us areas for recreation. They provide us with useful substances such as medicine 
• Ecosystems help to maintain the balance of life on the planet (nutrient cycle) 
• Habitats support a wide variety of organisms that interact in ways we do not fully understand, 
often to continue life on this planet  
• There are few foods, apart from some fish species that we can take directly from the wild in large 
quantities. There may be many more plants and animals that we could utilize as food sources 
• Fuels- fossil fuels cannot last forever. We still need timber to provide fuels such as biomass 
fuels 
• Drugs- drugs for treating cancer have been discovered in plants  
• Genes- as a result of selective breeding there is very little genetic diversity in our three main 
staples. It is important to conserve any locally adapted varieties that exist as well as any wild 
relatives that have genes we could use in the future. These plants can be kept in botanic gardens 
and their seeds in seed banks  
• Prevent species becoming extinct, especially those threatened directly by human activities",4144," Modern farming is using modern technology to achieve high yields of crop plants and livestock . Intensive farming involves growing crop plants over large areas at high densities and keeping livestock in large numbers . The large scale use of chemical fertilizers can reduce the structure of the soil . The addition of organic mature, such as manure helps to maintain a good soil structure .  Major pollutants of the sea include fertilizers, oil from oil wells and ships and industrial chemicals . Pollution is the harm done to the environment by the release of substances produced by human . Plastics are used for packaging packaging because they last a long time and do not decay easily .  The rivers may flow into a lake oo Once in the water, this stimulates population growth of algae . Once in water, the algae stimulates the growth of the algae in the rivers .  The Greenhouse Effect is a natural process which is essential to maintain suitable temperatures on earth . Some of the gases in the atmosphere act like a greenhouse to keep in heat to keep heat . Human activities are causing an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases . There is a fear that this is increasing the enhanced greenhouse effect .  Sulfur dioxide is released when fossil fuels are burned and together with nitrogen oxides from exhaust fumes, they cause acid rain . Acidified water that enters streams, lakes and rivers lowers the pH of these bodies . Small invertebrates and fish cannot survive in such low pH conditions .  Climate change is a result of changes to the composition of the atmosphere, pollution and overfishing are the reasons for species becoming endangered and extinct . Endangered species have to be conserved so we have a duty to conserve them, says the author .  Seeds are collected from plants in the wild and are put into long term storage . Seed banks are cold stores that conserve seeds of endangered or valuable species . Trees removed from forests should be replaced by planting or allowing time for natural replacement of seeds .",Medium

Diffusion 
• Diffusion is the net movement of particles or ions of a high concentration to a low concentration 
down a concentration gradient  
• Particles in a liquid or gas spread out from regions of high concentration to areas of  a low 
concentration until evenly spread 
• The difference between the concentration of molecules is called a concentration gradient 
• The steeper the concentration gradient, the faster the diffuser takes place 
• The movement of molecules by diffusion across the cell membrane is a passive movement as 
cells do not need to use energy to move the molecules 
Factors that affect diffusion 
• The distance the molecules have to travel- cell membranes are very thin 
• The concentration gradient- cells maintain a steep concentration gradient 
• The surface area- the larger the surface area, the more diffusion takes place 
• The temperature- molecules move faster and collide more often as the temperature increases, 
diffusion is faster at warmer temperatures 
• The size of the cell- as the cell gets bigger, its surface-to-volume ratio decreases, making 
diffusion less efficient 
Gases vs Liquids 
• Diffusion through air is 300 000 times faster than through water 
• In mammals the gas exchange surface is formed of the alveoli in the lungs 
• There are many alveoli to give a very large area of gas exchange 
• In plants, gas exchange occurs inside the leaves 
• The spongy mesophyll cells provide a large surface area for the exchange of gases 
• There are air spaces between the cells  
Water as a solvent 
• Solute + Solvent = Solution 
• Solute: what dissolves in the solvent 
• Solvent: the liquid in which the solvent dissolves 
• Water is known as a universal solvent 
• 75% of cytoplasm is water 
• Water is needed for transportation in plants and animals 
• Water is needed for digestion and excretion 
• Most chemical reactions occur in water 
Osmosis 
• Osmosis is a special type of diffusion. It is the diffusion of free water molecules from a high 
concentration of free water molecules to a low concentration through a partially permeable 
membrane 
 

Water Potential 
• The ability of water to move via osmosis 
• Water potential is caused by the amount of free water molecules available to move. So water 
molecules will always move from a high to a low water potential 
• A  dilute solution has a high water potential 
• A concentrated solution has a low water potential 
• Water potential is influenced by the amount of water available and the pressure exerted on water 
in plant cells by the cell wall 
• Osmosis is measured using an osmometer  
Osmosis in plant and animal cells 
Turgidity 
• Vacuoles store sugars and salts in a solution which creates a concentration gradient 
• Plant cells have partially permeable membranes, allowing water to diffuse into the cell 
• As the water diffuses into the cell, the cell swells up 
• Water pushes against the cell wall creating turgor pressure 
• A cell full to the point of bursting is known as turgid 
• Plant cells will not burst due to a cell wall 
• Many cells in the stem of the plant are supported by turgor pressure 
• Wilted plants lose turgidity due to water shortage 
Plasmolysis 
• Placing a cell in a concentrated salt/sugar solution results in: 
i. 
Water moving out via osmosis, vacuole shrinks and becomes limp 
ii. 
Said to become flaccid 
iii. 
If more water leaves the cell it will become plasmolysed, cytoplasm begins to move away 
from the cell wall 
• Only plant cells can become plasmolysed  
Active Transport 
• Active transport is the movement of ions and molecules in or out of a cell through the cell 
membrane against a concentration gradient, using energy released during the respiration 
• Active transport moves substances against as concentration gradient 
• Movement involves the use of ATP from aerobic respiration to supply energy 
• Structural changes in the carrier protein result in the movement through the membrane 
• Active transport enables root hair cells to take up ions and epithelial cells of the villi to take up 
glucose 
• Root hair cells and epithelial cells of villi have adapted for active transport by having many 
carrier proteins in their cell membranes and a high rate of respiration to provide energy 
• Active transport relies upon respiration to take up ions or molecules against a concentration 
gradient. Any factor that affects the rate of respiration will also affect the rate of active 
transport. So a lack of oxygen will reduce respiration rate and active transport. 
• An increase in temperature would increase the rate of respiration, up to a point, so would also 
have the same effects on active transport. The presence of poisons such as cyanide can stop, so 
active transport would stop altogether.",814," Diffusion is the net movement of particles or ions of a high concentration to a low concentration .

DNA 

 
 
• Each chromosome is made up of thousands of gene, genes carry genetic information 
• DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) belongs to a complex group of biological molecule known as nucleic acid. Each DNA 
molecule is made up of thousands of units each called a nucleotide. A single nucleotide is made up of 3 molecule: a 
phosphate, a sugar and a base 
• Sugar and phosphate molecules join together to form the backbone of the DNA strand, the base is attached to the 
sugar molecule 
• DNA consists of two strands together to form a double helix 
• Each strand contains chemical called Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine 
• Adenine always bonds with Thymine 
• Cytosine always bonds with Guanine

biology,Unit 5 Enzymes,"Unit 5 Enzymes 
• A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction and remains unchanged at the end of the reaction 
How enzymes work 
• Enzymes are biological catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions and remain unchanged at 
the end of the reactions. 
 
The reactions that enzymes catalyze can be divided into 3 groups: 
 
i. 
Breaking large molecules into small ones- This is important in nutrition when large food 
molecules are broken down into small ones so that they can be absorbed and used 
ii. 
Building up large molecules from smaller ones- Small molecules, such as glucose are 
joined together to make large molecules. These enzymes work inside cells to speed up the 
formation of storage molecules, such as starch, and structural molecules such as 
cellulose for cell walls of plants 
iii. 
Converting one small molecules into another- Many of the chemical reactions that occur 
inside cells involve small changes to molecules, such as adding or removing atoms of 
groups of atoms. 
 
 
 

All enzymes: 
• They are all proteins 
• Each enzyme only catalyzes one reaction 
• They can be used again and again 
• They are influenced by temperature  
• They are influenced by pH 
 
• Enzymes catalyze reactions in which substrates are converted into products. The enzyme and 
the substrate have shapes that are complimentary so that they fit together. Once they fit together 
the reaction van take place. When the reaction is over, the product, or products leave the enzyme 
and another substrate molecule enters 
 
• The part of the enzyme where the substrate fit and where the reaction takes place is the active 
site. The way of describing how enzymes work is known as the lock and key model. The enzyme 
and substrate combine like a key entering a lock to form an enzyme-substrate complex. 
 
Factors that affect enzyme action 
Temperature 
• The temperature at which the maximum rat of reaction occurs is called the optimum temperature. 
This is the best temperature for the enzyme. 
• Increasing the temperature of an enzyme controlled reaction increases the rate of reaction up to 
a maximum, which occurs at the optimum temperature. This is because the greater kinetic energy 
is causing a greater number of collisions between enzyme and substrate molecules. 
• At higher temperatures the rate of reaction decreases until it stops acting as a catalyst. This is 
due to a change in the active site which means the substrate can no longer fit. The enzyme is now 
denatured 
pH 
• Most enzymes work best at one value of pH 
• At either side of their optimum pH value, enzyme activity decreases 
• At some values of pH the shape of the active site changes so that substrate molecules no longer 
fit.",453," Enzymes are biological catalysts, they speed up chemical reactions and remain unchanged at the end of the reactions . The reactions that enzymes catalyze can be divided into 3 groups: Break large molecules into small ones, building up large molecules from smaller ones .

biology,Unit 6 Plant Nutrition,"Unit 6: Plant Nutrition 
The process of photosynthesis 
• Green plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water from their surroundings into 
simple sugars. This process is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which 
plants make carbohydrates from raw materials using sunlight energy. 
 
 
• If too much sugar is dissolved in the cell sap of plant cell it would make a very concentrated 
solution. This would make water mice in from other cells by osmosis and cause the cells to swell 
up. To prevent this, glucose molecules are linked together to form larger starch molecules which 
are insoluble and have no effect on osmosis. 
Testing a leaf for starch 
• Submerge a leaf in boiling water for one minute in order to destroy the cell membranes and make 
it easier to extract the chlorophyll 
• Put the leaf extract into a test tube of ethanol in a hot water bath for 10 minutes, the chlorophyll 
is extracted by dissolving into the ethanol. 
• Wash the leaf with cold water and spread it out on a white surface 
• Add a few drops of iodine solution 
• For a positive result the iodine solution will turn from the yellow-brown color to a blue-black 
color on the surface of the leaf.  
Requirements for photosynthesis  
• Light 
• Chlorophyll 
• Carbon dioxide 
• Water  
De-starching a plant 
• The plant is left in the dark for 48 hours in order to de-starch it. The plant is then given all the 
things that it needs except for the substance we are testing. 
 

Showing that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis 
• Take a de-starched variegated plant 
• Place the plant in the sun for 6 hours 
• Test the leaf for starch 
• Only the green parts of the leaf go blue-black  
• The green plants contain chlorophyll which is needed for photosynthesis to make starch 
• The white parts contain no chlorophyll, so no photosynthesis occurs there 
• Safety: wear eye protection. 
Showing that carbon dioxide and light are needed for photosynthesis 
• Take a de-starched leaf and enclose it in a plastic bag with a chemical that absorbs carbon 
dioxide (Soda Lime) 
• Leave the plant in the light for a few hours 
• Test the leaf for starch  
• The leaf should show a negative result for the starch test. Deprived of carbon dioxide the leaf is 
unable to photosynthesize. 
• A control experiment should be set up exactly in the same way without the soda lime. This means 
the plant in the control experiment does not have the carbon dioxide removed. Then we can be 
sure that it was the absence of carbon dioxide that caused the lack of starch and not keeping the 
plant inside a plastic bag.  
Showing that light is needed for photosynthesis  
• Take a de-starched plant. Cover part if the leaf with some aluminum foil to prevent light from 
getting through  
• Leave the plant in the light for a few hours 
• Test the leaf for starch 
• Only the uncovered parts of the test will go blue black. The parts of the leaf that were covered did 
not receive light and could not carry out photosynthesis and so could not make starch.

Efficient way to store energy in seeds  
 

• Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis. Some used for respiration in the plant but most 
diffuses out of the leaf through the stomata 
• Plant products 
1. Food for humans and livestock 
2. Raw materials for industry 
3. Provides medicines 
4. Provides habitats for animals and microorganisms  
5. Keeps the concentration of gases in the air constant (lowers the amount of carbon dioxide 
and increases the amount of oxygen) 
 
Glasshouse Production 
Conditions inside a glasshouse allow plants to: 
• Grow earlier in the year 
• Grow in places they would not usually grow  
The following conditions inside a glasshouse are controlled: 
Temperature  
• Sunlight heats up the inside of the glasshouse 
• The glass stops a lot of this heat from escaping  
• Electric heaters  are used in cold weather 
• Ventilator flaps are opened to cool the glasshouse on hot days  
Light 
• The glass lets in sunlight 
• Artificial light can be used to grow plants when light intensity gets too low 
• Blinds keep out very strong light and shading lowers the temperature in tropical countries 
Carbon dioxide 
• Growers can pump carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase the carbon dioxide 
concentration 
• They can also burn butane or natural gas which provides carbon dioxide and also heat to raise 
the temperature of glasshouses during cold water 
Water  
• Automatic sprinklers and humidifiers to ensure that plants always get enough water  
 
• All these factors are controlled by computers so few staff are needed. Sensors are used to detect 
changes in the limiting factors. Computers process the data transmitted from the sensors and 
control the heating, ventilation, lighting and shading in the glasshouse.  
 
 

Leaves  
Leaves have: 
• A large surface area to absorb light rays 
• A thin shape to allow efficient diffusion 
• Many chloroplasts to absorb light for the reactions that take place in photosynthesis 
• Veins to support the plant, carry water and ions to the leaf cells, take sucrose and amino acids 
away from the leaf and to other parts of the plant 
 
 
Adaptations of leaves for photosynthesis 
• Palisade mesophyll cells are packed tightly together and near the surface of the leaf to maximize 
the absorption of light where the intensity is the highest 
• There are many chloroplasts in the palisade mesophyll cells to absorb as much light as possible 
• Stomata open to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf. Carbon dioxide is a raw material 
for photosynthesis 
• Leaves are thin so that the carbon dioxide does not have to diffuse far from the atmosphere to 
the cells of the palisade and spongy mesophyll 
• There are large intercellular air spaces within the spongy mesophyll layer. This makes it easy 
for carbon dioxide to diffuse to all the mesophyll cells. Diffusion through air is much faster than 
diffusion from cell to cell. 

• Xylem veins bring water and ions to the mesophyll cells. Water is a raw material of 
photosynthesis and magnesium ions are needed by the cells to make chlorophyll 
• The sugar produced in photosynthesis is converted to sucrose and transported away from the 
leaves in the phloem and veins  
Stomata  
 
• Stomata are opened and closed by guard cells 
• Stomata are usually open during the day water passes into the guard cells via osmosis 
• Carbon dioxide diffuses inti the leaf, and oxygen and photosynthesis diffuses out 
• At night the stomata close, water passes out of the guard cells by osmosis and they straighten 
and move closer together to close the pores 
• The stomata also close in hot, dry weather to prevent the plant from wilting 
• Stomata are usually in the lower epidermis, but some plants like water lilies have them on their 
upper epidermis.  
 
Plant Nutrients 
• Needed for healthy growth 
• Deficiency symptoms as a result of nutrient shortage 
• Nitrate (nitrogen) - needed for the making of amino acids, to make proteins for growth. A 
deficiency in nitrates result in poor growth 
• Magnesium is needed to make chlorophyll.  A deficiency in magnesium results in the plant 
turning yellow (chlorosis) 
• Phosphates are needed to make DNA and for respiration  
• Fertilizers may be used as supplements to growth 
Gas exchange  
• Respiration is a property of all living things 
• Night: plants exchange gases with surroundings and respire  
• Day: carry out photosynthesis and respiration 
• Bright light allows a higher rate of photosynthesis, and more oxygen is produced 
• Oxygen is used for respiration in mitochondria and the rest diffuses out of the plant 
• Carbon dioxide made by respiration is used for photosynthesis and more diffuses into the plant 
to make up for the shortage  
 
 

Aquatic Plants 
• Investigate gas exchange using sodium hydrogen carbonate indicator solution 
1. Provides carbon dioxide to the solution 
2. Acts as a pH indicator and provides carbon dioxide 
3. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form carbonic acid 
• Sodium hydrogen carbonate indicator solution is red 
1. Turns yellow in acidic conditions 
2. Turns purple in the absence of carbon dioxide",1480, Green plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water from their surroundings into sugars . This process is called photosynthesis .

biology,Unit 7 Animal Nutrition,"Animal Nutrition 
A balanced diet 
• A balanced diet provides an adequate intake of biological molecules and energy needed to 
sustain the body and ensure good health and growth 
A balanced diet consists of: 
Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water and fibre. 
Each of these carries out one or more of three basic functions: 
• To provide energy- this is mainly the role of carbohydrates and fats. Proteins are used for 
energy only if they are in excess of requirements for growth, development, repair and 
replacement 
• To allow growth and repair of body cells and tissues. Proteins in the diet provide a source of 
amino acids for cells to make their own proteins 
• To regulate the body’s metabolism 
The energy required for body functions in known as the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which varies 
from person to person. (Adults require approx. 7000kJ/day.) 
Diet depends on age, sex and activity levels 
• Children have a greater energy requirement than adults because they have a higher BMR, 
because they are more active and are still developing 
• Elderly have a lower BMR, they have a lower energy and protein need. However, they still 
need to eat a healthy diet to remain healthy. 
• Women have a higher fat content than men, fat tissues has a lower BMR than muscle, so 
women generally have a lower energy requirement as compared to men. 
• The energy needs of occupation that involve physical activity are greater than less active 
jobs. 
• Women need extra nutrients when they are pregnant and when they are breastfeeding. 
Why is fat bad for us? 
• Fat is a more efficient store of energy than carbs 
Two main types of fat: 
1. Saturated fat comes from animals 
2. Unsaturated fat that comes from fish and plants 
 
• Saturated fat in the diet leads to an increase in cholesterol. High fat diets tend to increase the 
risk of producing more cholesterol and having a high concentration in the blood. 
• High concentrations of cholesterol leads to the narrowing of arteries and risk of developing 
high blood pressure and heart disease. 
Two types of unsaturated fat: 
1. Monounsaturated fats have little effect on blood cholesterol 
2. Polyunsaturated fats reduce cholesterol concentration which reduces heart disease

Balancing energy needs 
• When eating too much, your energy intake is greater than your energy output which leads to 
an increase in fat and body mass 
• To be obese, means to be severely overweight 
• Obesity is caused by: 
i. 
High intake of fatty and refined foods containing a lot of added sugar 
ii. 
Too little exercise 
iii. 
Social and emotional stress, ‘comfort eating’ 
• Health problems associated with being overweight: 
i. 
Heart disease  
ii. 
High blood pressure 
iii. 
Type 2 Diabetes 
iv. 
Arthritis  
Identification of obesity 
• Being above 20% of recommended weight for his or her height 
• Having a BMI greater than 30

Constipation 
• Constipation is caused by the lack of fibre or roughage in the diet. Fibre helps with the 
movement of down the alimentary canal 
• Soft foods do not instigate peristalsis as much as harder indigestible food 
• If the movement of food is slow, it will result in constipation and difficulty to defecate  
• Fruit and vegetables relieve constipation  
Weight Loss 
• Eat less high energy foods (lower energy intake) 
• Do more exercise (increase energy output) 
• Combine balanced diet with lower energy intake 
• Gradually increase exercise 
• Have an ideal but achievable weight loss goal 
• Have a positive self-image, be realistic 
• Do not attempt a diet which eliminates a food group  
Starvation and nutrient deficiency 
• Starvation results in a very low body mass with lack of fat and muscle wasting, and a lack of 
resistance to infections 

• In terms of an inadequate diet, starvation is caused by the drawing up upon stores of 
carbohydrates, fat and proteins for energy, however, water is not stored. The BMR is 
reduced, and the body begins to break down proteins in muscles as a source of energy  
• During starvation there are deficiencies of protective vitamins; people are at risk of 
developing infectious diseases 
• Malnourishment is caused by: contaminated water, poverty, malaria, social unrest/war, poor 
harvest/drought 
• The most common form of undernutrition is protein energy malnutrition (PEM) 
Nutritional Marasmus 
• Protein deficiency  
• Severe wasting, extreme thinness 
• Skin on upper arms, legs and buttocks may appear baggy 
• Sufferer may be too weak to walk or sit 
• Stomach muscles may stick out because muscles are weak and there may be gas in the 
upper gut caused by parasites or infection 
• Heart and other organs will be extremely weak  
Kwashiorkor  
• Protein deficiency  
• Occurs between ages 1 and 3 years 
• Growth failure, low weight, oedema (swelling) feet, legs, face and hands 
• Wasted muscles 
• Misery and apathy 
• Hair turns orangeish, straightens out and pulls out easily 
• Skin becomes lighter on the face 
• Stools are loose 
• Anaemia  
• Flaky skin, which may lead to ulcers and gangrene 
 
The above may be brought upon by living conditions and being displaced by the breast by the next 
child and given a low protein porridge diet (cassava and plantain). Can be brought on by infection 
(HIV, malaria, cholera, diarrhoea) 
With both marasmus and kwashiorkor increasing food intake should be manages carefully to 
prevent too much strain on the body  
Vitamin C deficiency  
• Scurvy (Bleeding Gums) 
• Vitamin C helps bond together cells and helps the use of calcium by the bones and teeth. 
Vitamin C is used to make skin, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. It also helps with 
healing of wounds and the formation of scar tissues 
• Lack of Vitamin C leads to areas of bruising and swelling of bone joints  
Vitamin D 
• Needed for the absorption of calcium, and regulation of deposition of calcium in bone cells 
• Deficiency causes rickets  

• Bones fail to grow properly and become soft, so when children start walking the bones bend 
with the weight of the body 
• In adults, deficiency gives rises to the condition known as osteomalacia which leads to the 
softening of the bones and increased chances of fractures 
Iron 
• A lack of iron causes anaemia  
• An adult needs about 16mg of iron a day 
• Women need enough iron in their diet to facilitate their menstruation cycle  
• Tiredness, lack of energy, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and a pale complexion  
Digestion  
• Ingestion is the taking of substances through the mouth 
• Digestion is the breaking down of large insoluble food molecules into small soluble 
molecules so that they can pass through the gut wall into the blood 
• Absorption is the movement of small food molecules and ions through the wall of the 
intestine into the blood 
• Assimilation is the movement of digestive food molecules into the cells of the body where 
they are used, becoming part of the cells 
• Egestion is the passing out of food that has not been digested or absorbed as faces through 
the anus 
Mechanical Digestion 
• Breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces of food without changing the 
molecules 
• Creates a larger surface area for enzymes to work on 
• Continues in the stomach-muscular contractions (peristalsis) 
• Small intestine: large globules of fat are broken down into smaller ones (emulsification by 
bile) 
Chemical Digestion 
• Breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into smaller soluble molecules by the action of 
enzymes 
• Makes these molecules soluble i.e. it can be absorbed through wall of small intestine into 
bloodstream/lymph (fat) 
• Occurs in mouth, stomach and small intestine  
Protease: protein molecule → amino acids 
Carbohydrase: starch molecule → glucose 
Lipase: fat molecule → fatty acids (3) and glycerol (1) 
 
 
 
 
 

Teeth 
• The teeth carry out mechanical digestion and break down food into smaller pieces 
• The teeth increase the surface area of food to aid the enzymes catalyse reactions 
• Adult humans have 32 teeth

• During our lives we have two sets of teeth  
• The first set, milk teeth only have 8 molars 
• Between the ages of 6-12 these teeth gradually fall out and are replaced by permanent teeth 
• The last of the permanent teeth come through at 18, called back molars or wisdom teeth 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Enamel forms the hard, outer layer of the crown od the tooth, above the gum 
• Inside this is softer dentine which is like a bone in structure 
• A layer of cement fixes the root of the gum into a bony socket in the jaw 
• The root is the part that is below the gum 
• The pulp cavity is a space in the tooth containing several nerves and blood vessels 
Healthy teeth and gums 
• Tooth decay is caused by bacteria in the mouth, they mix with saliva to make plaque 
• Bacteria in plaque changes sugar into acid via anaerobic respiration  
• The acid can attack the enamel and propel tooth decay 
• The acid will then attack dentine and subsequently the pulp cavity and will cause severe tooth 
ache 
• The acid will make gums red and swollen 
• Brushing teeth at a 45° angle clean the outside teeth with short gentle movements  
• Brush the inside of the teeth by moving the brush gently back and forth  
• Brush biting surfaces with short scrubbing strokes 
• Tooth decay can be avoided with a good toothbrush, not eating sugary foods and regular 
dental visits  

Mouth, oesophagus and stomach 
Chewing and swallowing 
• 
The incisors and canine teeth bite the food into chunks 
• 
The molar and premolar teeth grind the food into smaller 
pieces 
• 
The tongue mixed the food with saliva and the moistened 
food is chewed 
• 
The food is then rolled into a ball or bolus 
• 
The salivary glands make saliva which contains: 
i. 
Mucus; a slimy substance that lubricate the passage of the 
food bolus down the throat 
ii. 
Amylase; the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of 
starch to maltose 
• 
The food pushes your soft palette upwards preventing 
food from going into your nose 
• 
When you swallow, the epiglottis covers the opening to 
your trachea 
• 
The food squeezes past your epiglottis and into your 
oesophagus  
The oesophagus/gullet 
• Food passes down the oesophagus into the stomach 
• Has longitudinal muscles in its wall 
• The movement of food down the oesophagus is due to the contraction of muscles called 
peristalsis  
• The circular muscles relax and the longitudinal muscles contract to widen the oesophagus to 
move the food along 
• Peristalsis also occurs in the large intestine  
The Stomach 
• Muscular bag that can hold 1 or more litres of food 
• The walls of the stomach make gastric juice 
• This contains pepsin that digests proteins to smaller molecules called polypeptides 
• Gastric juice also contains hydrochloric acid which carries out two important function due to 
its low pH: 
1. It kills bacteria in food and the low pH denatures the enzymes in harmful 
microorganisms  
2. The acid provides the optimum conditions for the enzyme pepsin 
• The mixture, of food, gastric juice and hydrochloric acid is known as chyme 
• The muscular walls of the stomach churn up the food making sure it mixes well with the juices 
• After 2-3 hours of churning, the contents of the stomach are like a runny liquid 
• A ring of muscle called the pyloric sphincter opens to let the food pass a little at a time into 
the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum  
 
 
 

The small intestine and absorption  
• The small intestine is 6m long 
• The first part is the duodenum that leads to the ileum 
 
• The pancreas is connected to the duodenum by the pancreatic duct 
• Pancreatic juice flows down the duct to meet food arriving from the stomach. Pancreatic juice 
contains: 
i. 
Amylase → breaks down starch to maltose 
ii. 
Trypsin→ a protease that breaks down proteins and polypeptides to peptides 
iii. 
Lipase → breaks down fats to fatty acids and glycerol 
• The enzymes do not all work well under acid conditions so the pancreas created an alkali 
(sodium hydrogen carbonate) that neutralises the acidic food which enter the duodenum from 
the stomach 
  
• Bile enters the duodenum through the bile duct 
• Bile is a yellow-green fluid made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder 
• Bile is alkaline and neutralises the acid which is added to food in the stomach  
• Bile emulsifies fat by breaking down large globules of fat into smaller globules  
 
• Cells lining the ileum make enzymes that complete the digestion of food: 
i. 
Proteases that break down peptides to amino acids 
ii. 
Sucrase that breaks down sucrose to glucose and fructose 
iii. 
Maltose is broken down by maltase to glucose on the membrane of the epithelium 
lining the small intestine  
Absorption 
• Absorption is the movement of digested food molecules through the wall of the intestine into 
the blood or lymph  
• Digested food includes simple sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and glucose  
• These molecules pass through the walls of the intestine either by diffusion or by active 
transport 
• The small intestine has adapted to I t function of absorption by: 
i. 
Having a large surface area (9𝑐𝑚2) 
ii. 
A thin lining (one cell thick) so digested food can easily pass into the blood and lymph  
• The small intestine has a folded inner lining with millions of tiny, finger-like projections called 
villi. The epithelial cells lining the villi have microscopic projections called microvilli, these 
vastly increase the absorptive area of the cell membrane of the epithelial cells 
• The digested food reaches the capillaries and lacteals (lymph capillaries) in the villi 
• Absorbed food molecules are transported quickly to the liver by the hepatic portal vein 
• Fatty acids and glycerol are transported by the lymph 
• Movement of the gut empties the lacteal and lymph moves slowly through the lymphatic 
vessels which are thin walled veins, eventually enter the flood near the heart. As a result, fat 
does not enter the bloodstream quickly.  
 
 
 

Large intestine and intestinal disease 
The large intestine  
• The large intestine is about 1.5m long and can be divided into the caecum, appendix and 
rectum  
• By the time the food gets to the colon, it is now mainly fibre, dead cells and some water as 
most has been absorbed by the small intestine 
• The solid waste, or faeces is stored in the rectum and egested through the anus  
Cholera 
• Cholera us a disease caused by bacteria  
• The main symptom is diarrhoea (loss of watery faeces from the intestine) 
• Some are infected by the disease but may not actually suffer from the disease, this is called 
symptomless carriers  
Transmission 
• Cholera occurs in areas where there is lack of proper sanitation, an unclean water supply or 
contaminated food  
• Cholera is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated water or contaminated food 
which has faecal material 
• Transmission can occur by infected people handling food or utensils without washing their 
hands 
Effects on the body 
• Most of the bacteria of cholera is killed by acidic conditions in the stomach, however, some 
pathogens may survive and reach the small intestine. Here they burrow through the mucous 
lining the wall of the intestine and start to produce a toxin 
• Molecules of this toxin enter the epithelial cells of the intestines here they disrupt the 
functioning of the cell surface membrane of the epithelial cells 
• Chloride ions pass out the cells into the space inside the intestine 
• The accumulation of ions in the lumen creates a water potential gradient 
• Water flows by osmosis from the cells and from the blood into the lumen 
• Movement of the ions and water from the blood into the lumen of the intestine cause 
symptoms of cholera-dehydration and diarrhoea  
Oral Rehydration Therapy 
• Cholera is treated by giving people a solutions of slats and glucose to drink. This is oral 
rehydration therapy (ORT) 
• The ORT solution contains water to rehydrate blood and other tissues, sodium ions to 
replace the ions  lost from blood and tissue fluid, glucose to provide energy for the active 
uptake of sodium ions from the intestine, other ions such as potassium and chloride ions to 
replace those lost in diarrhoea  
• During a cholera outbreak, sachets containing salts and glucose are made available, the 
contents of these packages dissolve in the boiling water so the administrator requires little 
training to administer-2 
•  the medicine in large volumes at regular intervals 
• When these ions are absorbed the water potential of the epithelial cells decreases and water 
is absorbed to make up for the water lost in diarrhoea",3138," A balanced diet provides an adequate intake of biological molecules and energy needed to sustain the body and ensure good health and growth . The energy required for body functions in known as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) varies from person to person . Children have a greater energy requirement than adults because they are more active and are still developing .  Obesity is caused by high intake of fatty and refined foods containing a lot of added sugar . The body cannot survive without water and produces twice as much energy as protein and carbohydrates . Eating too much leads to an increase in body weight and body mass . Obesity can be caused by: heart disease, high blood pressure and excessive exercise .  Starvation results in a very low body mass with lack of fat and muscle wasting, and a lack of resistance to infections . Malnourishment is caused by: contaminated water, poverty, malaria, social unrest/war, poor/harvest/drought .  Vitamin C leads to areas of bruising and swelling of bone joints .

biology,Unit 8 Plant Transport,"Plant Transport  
Transport systems  
• Small organisms don’t need transport systems, they have small, flat bodies so they rely on 
diffusion  
• Large organisms have transport systems which move fluids through tubes so that all the fluid 
moves in the same direction in each tube. This type of transport is called mass flow 
• Vertebrates have a circulatory system with a pump 
• Plants have two separate transport systems: xylem and phloem 
Xylem  
• Water and minerals travel in xylem vessels 
• Xylem vessels have thick cellulose cell walls strengthened by lignin. The inside of the walls 
are hollow. Xylem vessels are dead cells 
• Xylem vessels transport water and minerals from the root to the shoot and leaves. This 
transport only occurs in one direction  
• Thick walls also help support the plant  
Phloem  
• Phloem is made of columns of living cells. They transport food in the form of sugars 
• Sugars are carried from the leaves to the growing and storage parts of the plants. This 
movement takes place in both directions  
• Phloem cells are also called sieve tubes. Cells are joined by small holes in the cell walls at the 
end of each cell forming a continuous system. The end of the cell walls are called sieve plates. 
 

 
Water uptake by the roots  
• The main function of the roots is to anchor the plant and take up water and mineral ions 
Explaining how water is taken up by the roots: 
1. Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules through a semi permeable membrane (root 
hair cells) from a high water potential (inside the cells) down a concentration gradient  
2. The water potential gradient in the soil is higher than that in the cell because there are more 
mineral ions in the soil water 
3. The water molecule then moves from cell to cell until it reaches the xylem vessels. Once water 
enters the vacuoles, it increases the water potential of that vacuole, thus creating another 
water potential gradient as the cortex neighbouring cells have a lower water potential. This 
process repeats itself until it reaches the xylem vessels  
4. From here it moves up the plant towards the stem and spongy mesophyll cells in the leaves 
It’s a push, not a pull 
• Water needs to flow against gravity. The slight push from water entering from below is not 
enough to overcome gravity 
• Transpiration is the evaporation of water from the surfaces of the mesophyll cells in the 
leaves which leads to water vapour diffusing out of the stomata and into the atmosphere 
• Water is pulled up the xylem using transpiration pull 
• Mass flow of water in the xylem depends on two properties: 
i. 
Cohesion: water molecules sticking together 
ii. 
Adhesion: water molecules sticking to the inside of a vessel 
• Transpiration stream- a continuous flow of water through the xylem 
→ Keeps the plant from wilting 

→ Provides water for photosynthesis 
Wilting 
• Stomata open during the day for the diffusion of carbon dioxide into cells  
• Close at night to reduce transpiration  
• If the soil water is scarce, the plant will wily  
→ Water lost from cells result in turgidity  
→ No support for plant so leaves start to droop 
→ Wilting helps move the leaves out of direct sunlight to reduce transpiration  
Factors affecting transpiration  
1. Light 
• Stomata open when light intensity increases 
• Increase in transpiration 
2. Humidity  
• In humid conditions water vapour levels close to that in stomata, slows down diffusion, 
slows down transpiration 
3. Air temperature 
• High temperature, more kinetic energy in water molecules, faster diffusion from cell to 
atmosphere 
4. Air movement 
• Humid air taken away by wind which maintains the concentration gradient between the 
leaf and air 
Functions of xylem and phloem  
Xylem  
• Transports water and mineral ions from roots to stems, leaves, flowers and fruits  
• Movement is only in one direction  
Phloem  
• Transports sucrose, amino acids and hormones throughout the plant 
• Sucrose is a complex sugar used for energy  
• Made in the leaves using sugars from photosynthesis and starch from storage organs (roots 
and stems) 
• Hormones control cell division for growth in all parts of the plant  
• Movement in two directions: leaves to roots and leaves to flowers (upwards and downwards) 
Translocation 
• Translocation is the movement of organic solutes from a source to a sink through the phloem 
by means of mass flow 
Sucrose 
• Broken down to simple sugars used for respiration  
• Changed to starch for storage in root cortex or seeds 
• Used to make cellulose (cell walls) in root and shoot tips  
• Stored in fruits to make them sweet in order to attract animals  

 
Aphids and phloem transport  
• Aphids- insects feed on phloem sap (food) 
• Piercing mouthparts called stylets-inserted into a single phloem tube 
• Pressure of the sap causes it to pass into the stylet 
• Used to study sugar transport 
• Passage of sugars are traced using isotopically labelled sugars 
• Some systemic pesticides are taken up in sap which kills aphids 
Transpiration vs Translocation  
• Transpiration helps to create a pull that allows for water and minerals to move up in the plant  
→Passive process that depends on diffusion  
 
• Translocation is an active process in the phloem 
→ Leaves are the source and the place of respiring tissues, regions of growth, regions of storage 
and sink 
→ Phloem cells are alive and contain cytoplasm  
→ Active transport needed to move sugars against a concentration gradient  
A source is the place in the plant where the substance begins its journey  
A sink is the place where the journey ends

Circulation 
The circulatory system 
• (Most) animals circulatory systems consist of blood, some sort of pump and blood vessels 
• Circulatory systems in animals transport useful substances such as oxygen and nutrients 
• Circulatory systems also transport waste such as carbon dioxide 
Blood circulation  
• The heart is a pump that circulates blood through blood vessels 
• Blood flows in arteries away from the heart to the different organs of the body 
• Blood flows back to the heart in veins 
• The smallest blood vessels that connect arteries to veins are capillaries 
• The circulatory system allows one way flow of blood around the body 
• The heart pumps blood giving it pressure so that it flows inside arteries and this helps maintain 
one way flow 
• This is good for getting blood to capillaries 
• High pressure blood will damage the delicate capillaries so small muscular blood vessels known 
as arterioles reduce the pressure before blood enters capillaries  
• When blood leaves the capillaries the blood pressure is even lower 
• There are semi-lunar valves in veins to make sure that blood does not flow backwards away from 
the heart 
• If this happens veins swell and blood is not circulated properly  
• Each valve has three of these pockets 
• The valves open when the pressure of the blood pushes them, but they close when blood flows 
back to fill these pockets 
• The semi-lunar valves in the heart are at places where blood leaves the heart chambers to enter 
arteries  
• There are also valves between the chambers the heart  
Single circulation (e.g. fish) 
• Blood flows through the heart once during a complete circuit of the body 
• Blood arriving to the heart via veins is deoxygenated 
• The heart pups blood to an artery which takes it to the gills to be oxygenated 
• The blood flows from gills to arteries and to body organs 
Double circulation  
• Occurs in mammals 
• Blood flows through the heart twice during one complete circuit around the body 
• The mammalian heart is divided into two halves: left and right  
• The septum is a thick wall of muscle that separates the two halves of the heart 
 
 

• The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs and back to the heart again 
• Pressure requirement is low as there is little resistance to flow in the lungs 
• Oxygenated blood returns to heart via pulmonary vein 
• Gas exchange takes place in lungs –oxygen enters the blood, carbon dioxide exits 
• Oxygen blood is bright red in colour 
 
• The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body and back to the heart 
again 
• Pressure is greater as there is more resistance to flow 
• Gas exchange occurs in organs- oxygen leaves the blood, carbon dioxide enters 
• Deoxygenated blood is dark red in colour 
The heart  
• 
Right atrium: collects deoxygenated 
blood via vena cava & pumps it to the right 
ventricle 
• 
Right ventricle: pumps deoxygenated 
blood to lungs via pulmonary artery 
• 
Pulmonary artery: carries deoxygenated 
blood from right ventricles to lungs 
• 
Septum: separates left and right sides of 
the heart 
• 
Left atrium: collect oxygenated blood via 
pulmonary veins and pumps it to left ventricle 
• 
Left ventricle: pumps oxygenated blood 
to the body via the aorta 
• 
Aorta: carries oxygenated blood from the 
left ventricle to the rest of the body 
• 
Tricuspid & bicuspid valves: prevents the 
backflow of blood into the atria when ventricles 
contract 
• Pulmonary & aortic valves; prevent 
backflow of blood from the arteries into 
the ventricles 
• Ventricles have more muscular walls than atria as they have to pump blood further than the atria 
• The left ventricle has a more muscular wall than the right ventricle as it has to pump blood 
around the body and has to overcome resistance to flow  
 
Heart action 
• The heart pumps blood when its muscles contract  
• When muscles contract, the chamber squeezes out blood 
• After contraction, relaxation occurs, allowing blood to fill again 
• The two sides of the heart work in sync 
• The atria contract and relax at the same times 
• The ventricles contract and relax at the same time  

• During the relaxation phase, blood flows into the atria from the veins 
• During contraction: 
i. 
Atria contract and force blood into the ventricles, valves between atria and ventricles 
open due to pressure of blood  
ii. 
The ventricles contract to force blood into the arteries. The valves close to prevent back 
flow 
 
The electrocardiogram (ECG) 
• The control of heartbeat depends on electrical activity  
• Heart disorders can produce irregularities in this activity  
• An ECG is used to detect these defects 
• Electrode are taped to various positions on the body and the electrical activity 
 
Heart Sounds 
• The sound the heart makes when it beats is ‘lub-dub’ 
• During contraction, the ventricle walls contract to force blood out of the pulmonary artery and 
aorta  
• The pressure of the blood causes the atrioventricular valves to shut, preventing backflow 
• This produces the sound ‘lub’ 
• During the relaxation phase, the ventricles relax 
• The pressure of the blood in arteries causes the semi-lunar valves to shut, preventing backflow 
• This produces the sound ‘dub’ 
• Irregularities in the heartbeat can be detected by listening to these heart sounds 
 
The heart and exercise 
• During exercise, your muscles need more energy from respiration to contract 
• The heart beats faster and the artery dilate 
• These changes increase the flow of blood of blood to muscles and result in: 
i. 
Increase in removal of carbon dioxide 
ii. 
Increase in supply of oxygen 
• You can detect the flow of blood through your pulse 
• The resting pulse rate is an indication of a person’s fitness 
The table below shows the correspondence between resting pulse rate and fitness

Less muscular than arteries 
Less elastic than arteries

Capillaries  
Very narrow 
Single layer of very thin cells  
No muscle tissue 
 
How blood vessels are adapted to their functions 
• Elastic fibres in arteries stretch and recoil  
• The recoil of elastic fibres help to push blood along so maintaining pressure 
• Capillaries provide a huge surface area for exchange between blood and cells 
• Blood moves slowly giving adequate time for exchange 
• As the walls are one cell wall thick, it is easy for substances to diffuse 
• Pressure of blood in veins is low 
• It gets moved along by the contraction of muscles and organs that surround veins 
Arterioles 
• Small subdivisions of arteries that carry blood to capillary networks 
• Have muscle in their walls 
• Function; blood transport and regulating blood pressure 
• Receive nerve impulses that trigger hormones to regulate diameter 
Venules 
• Small blood vessels that collect blood from capillary beds 
• Thin walled vessels that unite to form veins 
• Transport deoxygenated blood 
 

Shunt vessels 
• Vessel that links an artery directly to a vein  
• Allows blood to bypass capillaries in certain areas 
• Control blood flow by constriction and dilation 
• Endotherms- constrict in response to cold, reducing heat loss 
 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) 
• Coronary heart disease is caused by blockage of the coronary arteries that supply the heart 
with glucose and oxygen  
 
Risk factors of CHD 
i. 
Eating a diet with too much saturated animal fat 
ii. 
Being overweight  
iii. 
Smoking  
iv. 
Taking little or no exercise 
v. 
Stress 
vi. 
Genes inherited 
vii. 
Age – risk increases with age 
viii. 
Sex – men are more likely to get CHD than women  
 
Treatment of CHD 
• Coronary artery bypass- this is done by grafting a blood vessel from another part of the body, 
above or below the narrowed or blocked area. 
• Coronary angioplasty-this is whereby a small balloon is inflated inside the artery to widen it. A 
small metal tube is then inserted to help keep the artery open. This tube is called a stent  
• Antiplatelet medicines (e.g. aspirin) – prevent blood clots from forming in the arteries. Low 
dosage of daily aspirin is used for people with CHD, angina, heart attack patients, coronary 
stent and bypass surgery 
Other conditions 
• Atherosclerosis- cholesterol sticks to the walls of the artery, effectively narrowing them 
• Thrombosis- artery walls become rough which can cause blood to clot and block the vessel 
• Angina- chest pains caused by not enough oxygen getting to the heart muscle 
• Angina acts as a warning for a heart attack  
• Total blockage or thrombosis can cause a heart attack  
• When this happens supply of oxygen is cut off  
• Causes severe pain and the heart is damaged 
• The heart may stop beating altogether – cardiac arrest 
 
Blood Composition 
 
Plasma (accounts for 55% of the blood volume) 
Consists of water with chemicals dissolved in it: 
i. 
Nutrients (glucose, amino acids, lipids, vitamins, mineral ions such as sodium and chloride ions) 
ii. 
Wastes, such as urea and carbon dioxide 
iii. 
Blood proteins, such as albumen and antibodies 
iv. 
Hormones. such as insulin, glucagon and adrenaline 

Blood cells  
 Red blood cells have no nuclei, and have cytoplasm full of haemoglobin for transporting oxygen. They 
are disc shaped with the middle pushed in, they have a large surface area to volume ration that aids 
with their function.  
 
White blood cells have nuclei. They may appear white when spun around in a centrifuge, but with closer 
observation- they are colourless and have no pigment that gives them colour. We have to stain them in 
order for them to be visible  
 
Platelets are tiny fragments of cells that cause blood to clot when you cut yourself.  
 
Blood in defence 
White blood cells defend us against diseases, there are two types: lymphocytes and phagocytes. 
 
Phagocytes 
 
They surround pathogens, ingest them and take them into food vacuoles.  
Then they digest them by using enzymes that kill the pathogens, this is called phagocytosis  
 
Lymphocytes 
 
They make proteins called antibodies that have a particular binding site, much like an enzyme, each 
antibody’s binding site combines with one particular type of pathogen.  
Antibodies attack pathogens in the following ways: 
i. 
They make them sick (agglutinate) 
ii. 
They dissolve their cell membranes  
iii. 
They neutralise toxins produced by pathogens 
After a person has had a disease, the lymphocytes remain to produce more antibodies for that 
pathogen if the disease is encountered again. This is called immunity.  
 
Blood clotting  
 
• When you cut yourself – you bleed 
• Platelets helps the blood thicken and the bleeding stops 
• The thickened blood forms a clot  
• This is a barrier against infection 
• Platelets release a substance that converts the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble fibrin 
• Fibrin forms a meshwork of fibres 
• Red blood cells get trapped in these threads and clot 
• The clot hardens to form a scab 
• The skin heals and the scab falls off 
 
 
 
 
 

Lymph and tissue fluid 
 
Tissue fluid 
• Some constituents of plasma move out the capillary walls to form tissue fluid surrounding cells 
• Tissue fluid bathes the cell providing a stable environment  
• Tissue fluid helps substances diffuse in and out of cells 
• Useful substance such as oxygen and glucose diffuse in from the tissue fluids and waste 
products diffuse out 
• Most fluid tissue re-enters the capillary  
• Fluid flows from plasma back into plasma but some drains into our lymphatic system  
 
The lymphatic system  
• The remaining plasma enter the lymph capillaries, it is now called lymph  
• Lymph consist of plasma and white blood cells, but has no red blood cells or large plasma 
proteins  
• Lymph capillaries have tiny valves allowing entry but no exit  
• They join up to form lymph vessels  
• Similar structure to veins: thin walls and semi lunar valves  
• Has no pump so it dependent on the contraction of muscles 
• Lymph flows from tissues to heart 
• Substances empty into subclavian veins, mixes with blood and enters the heart via the vena cava 
• They are many lymph nodes throughout the lymph vessels  
• Lymphocytes are in the lymph nodes where they multiply during an infection and produce 
antibodies",2155," Circulatory systems in animals transport useful substances such as oxygen and nutrients . They also transport waste such as carbon dioxide . The circulatory system allows one way flow of blood around the body . The heart pumps blood giving it pressure so that it flows inside arteries . This is good for getting blood to capillaries .  Blood pups blood to an artery which takes it to the gills to be oxygenated . Blood flows through the heart twice during a complete circuit of the body . The mammalian heart is divided into two halves: left and right . The left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the lungs and back to the heart again .  The control of heartbeat depends on electrical activity and electrical activity . An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to detect irregularities in this activity . Coronary heart disease (CHD) is caused by blockage of the coronary arteries . The resting pulse rate is an indication of your fitness .  Atherosclerosis sticks to the walls of the artery, effectively narrowing them . Thrombosis- artery walls become rough which can cause blood to clot and block the vessel . Angina- chest pains caused by not enough oxygen getting to the heart muscle - can cause a heart attack .  Platelets release a substance that converts the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble fibin . Red blood cells get trapped in these threads and clot . The clot hardens to form a scab and the skin heals and the scab falls off .",Medium
chemistry,Unit 1 Particles and Purification,"Unit 1: Particles and Purification 
Solids, Liquids and Gases 
• All matter is made up of particles. Three types of particles make up matter: 
1. An atom is the smallest particle that cannot be broken down by chemical means 
2. A molecule is a particle of two or more atoms joined together 
3. An ion is an atom or groups of atoms that carry an electrical charge

Diffusion 
• The kinetic particle theory states that molecules in solids, liquids and gases are constantly 
moving 
• Diffusion is the random movement of particles until evenly spread 
• The overall direction of the movement of the particles is from where the particles are more 
concentrated to where the particles are less concentrated, however, since the particles are 
moving randomly, some are moving from less concentrated regions to even more concentrated 
regions 
• Diffusion does not occur in solids because of the arrangement of their particles 
• Diffusion occurs faster in gases than in liquids because gas particles move more rapidly than 
liquid particles 

• The speed at which diffusion occurs depends on how heavy its molecules are. Lighter molecules 
diffuse faster than heavier molecules 
• The rate of diffusion depends on the relative molecular mass. Substances with a high relative 
mass diffuse more slowly than those with a low relative molecular mass 
Apparatus for measuring 
• In chemistry, mass is measured in grams, temperature in °C and volume  in 𝑐𝑚3 or 𝑑𝑚3 
• Volume can be measured using: 
1. A volumetric cylinder 
2. A volumetric pipette 
3. A burette 
4. A volumetric flask 
• The volume of gases can be measured using a gas syringe or an upturned measuring cylinder 
(displacement) 
• Accuracy depends on: 
1. Using apparatus with small scale divisions 
2. Reading the measurements accurately (no error of parallax) 
3. Repeating measurements to remove anomalies 
4. Using the apparatus carefully 
Paper Chromatography 
• Chromatography is a method for separating and purifying colored compounds using filter paper 
and a solvent 
• Chromatography is used to identify compounds 
• Locating agents are used to make colorless compounds visible on a chromatogram 
• The compounds on a chromatogram can be identified using their Rf value

Chemical Purity 
 
• When chemists talk about purity they mean there is only one substance present 
• Medicinal drugs and food additives must be pure to avoid harming people 
• The computer industry needs pure silicon to make computer chips, to prevent the chips from not 
working properly 
• The melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from solid to a liquid 

• The boiling point is the temperature at which a solid changes to a liquid 
• Melting and boiling points can be used to identify pure substances 
• A pure substance melts and boils at a definite temperature 
• An impure substance melts and boils over a range of temperatures 
• Simple distillation is used to separate water from a dissolved salt 
• Fractional distillation is used to separate more volatile liquids from less volatile liquids 
Methods of Purification 
• A dissolved solid is called a solute 
• The liquid that dissolves in the solute is called a solvent 
• Solute + Solvent = Solution 
• An undissolved solid cab be separated from a solution or liquid by passing it through a 
piece of filter paper in a funnel. This is called filtration. 
• Decanting is to pour off a solution leaving the solid behind 
• Centrifuging is used with heavy solids, the machine spins the test tubes at high speeds 
forcing the solid particles to the bottom so the liquid can be poured off 
Crystallization  
• 
Step 1: evaporate off some solution to form a saturated 
solution 
• 
Step 2: leave to cool and crystals will form 
• 
Step 3: Filter crystals 
• 
Step 4: Rinse and Dry 
 
 
 
Solvent Extraction 
• Solvent extraction can be used to separate two solutes dissolved in a solvent. This is especially 
useful if one of the solutes is volatile- evaporates easily. A second solvent is used to extract one 
of the solids from the first solution. The second solvent must not mix with the first- we say it is 
immiscible  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Simple Distillation 
• Simple distillation is used to obtain a solvent from a solution 
 
 
Fractional distillation  
• Used to separate mixtures of different boiling points 
• Liquids which are immiscible can be separated using this method 
• This method is very important for the separation of petroleum fraction and separating water 
from ethanol 
• Fractional distillation uses a tall column in which continuous evaporation and condensation of 
the liquid occurs 
• There is a range of temperature in the column; higher at the bottom and lower at the top. The 
more volatile liquid evaporates and moves further up the column. This is collected as the 
distillate.",855," The kinetic particle theory states that molecules in solids, liquids and gases are constantly constantly moving .

chemistry,Unit 10 Acids and Bases,"Acids and Bases 
• Acids exist naturally in foods and plants 
• Examples of acids include: hydrochloric acid, ethanoic acid, acetic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid 
etc. 
• All acids form hydrogen ions, 𝐻+, when dissolved in water. It is the hydrogen ions that make a 
solution acidic  
• Alkalis are the opposite of acids when they react 
• Examples of alkalis include: sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and ammonia ‘ 
• Alkalis form hydroxide ions, 𝑂𝐻−, when they dissolve in water 
• Substances that are neither acidic nor alkaline are neutral 
• Pure water is neutral  
The pH Scale  
• The pH scale is used to show whether a solution is acidic, alkaline or neutral  
• The pH scale runs from 0 to 14 
• Acids have a pH below 7 
• Alkalis have a pH above 7 
• A solution with a lower pH has a higher concentration of hydrogen ions 
• The higher the pH, the more alkaline the solution is 
• A higher pH means a higher concentration of hydroxide ions 
• We can measure pH using universal indicator paper or a pH electrode connected to a pH meter 
Using Universal Indicator  
 
 
• An acid-alkali indicator is a chemical which changes colour when we add an acid or an alkali 
• Universal indicator is a mixture of indicators which shows a range of colours depending on the 
pH 
The litmus test  
• Litmus is an indicator that has two colours, red and blue 
• If a solution is acidic it turns blue litmus red 
• If a solution is alkaline it turns red litmus blue 
• If a solution is acidic red litmus paper remains red 
• If a solution is alkaline blue litmus paper remains blue  
• The simplest definition of an acid states that an acid is a substance that dissolves in water to 
form hydrogen ions 
𝐻𝐶𝑙 (𝑔) + 𝑎𝑞→𝐻+(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐶𝑙−(𝑎𝑞) 

• We can show that water plays an important part by first dissolving hydrogen chloride gas in a 
solvent called methylbenzene 
• The solution does not turn blue litmus red 
• This shows that the solution is not acidic 
• When we shake this solution with water the litmus does turn red 
• This shows that an acid has been formed once water has been added 
Chemical properties of acids 
Reaction of acids and metals  
• Many metals react with dilute acids to form a salt and hydrogen  
• However, nitric acid does not always give off hydrogen with metals unless it is very dilute  
𝑀𝑔(𝑠) + 2𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) →𝑀𝑔𝐶𝑙2(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2(𝑔) 
• The reaction of an acid with a metal is an example of a redox reaction. The metal loses electrons 
to form metal ions. The metal is oxidised. Hydrogen ions gain electrons to form hydrogen gas. 
The hydrogen ions are reduced  
Reaction of acids with metal oxides 
• Acids react with many metal hydroxides to form a salt and water  
𝐶𝑢𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐻2𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) →𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
 
Reaction of acids with metal hydroxides or aqueous ammonia  
• Acids react with many metal hydroxides to form a salt and water  
𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻 (𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻𝑁𝑂3(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎𝑁𝑂3(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂 (𝑙) 
• This is an example of a neutralisation reaction 
Reaction of acids with carbonates 
• Carbonates react with acids to form a salt, water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide bubbles 
off as a gas 
𝐶𝑢𝐶𝑂3(𝑠) + 𝐻2𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) →𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂 (𝑙) + 𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
Hydrogencarbonates react in a similar way: 
𝑁𝑎𝐻𝐶𝑂3(𝑠) + 𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) + 𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
• Sodium hydrogencarbonate is used in baking powder together with powdered tartaric acid 
• In the presence of moisture, carbon dioxide is given off which makes the cake rise  
Neutralisation 
𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
𝑁𝑎+ (𝑎𝑞) + 𝑂𝐻−(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻+(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐶𝑙−(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎+(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐶𝑙−(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
𝑂𝐻−(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻+(𝑎𝑞) →𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
 
 
• Any combination of an acid and alkali neutralisation reaction will produce the above ionic 
equation  

• The reasons for this being: every acid has hydrogen ions dissolved in water and every alkali has 
hydroxide ions dissolved in water  
• So these two ions combine to make water  
Acids, bases and protons  
• A hydrogen ion is formed by the removal of a single electron from a hydrogen atom  
• Nearly all hydrogen atoms have a single proton and no neutrons in their nuclei 
• So a hydrogen ion is nothing more than a proton  
• We define acids and bases more generally by seeing what happens to hydrogen ions when acids 
react with bases 
• An acid is a proton donor 
• A base is a proton acceptor  
Strong and weak acids 
• A strong acid is completely ionised when it dissolves in water. There are no molecules of the 
acid present 
• Weak acids are generally organic acids such as citric acid, ethanoic acid 
• A weak acid is only partly ionised when it dissolves in water  
• There are lots of acid molecules present but very few ions 
• The electric conductivity of a solution depends on the number of ions present, the more ions, the 
greater the conductivity 
• A strong acid conducts better that a weak acid of the same concentration  
• This is because there is a greater concentration if ions in the strong acid compared to the weak 
acid 
• A stronger acid has a lower pH than a weak acid of the same concentration  
• This is because there is a greater concentration of ions in the strong acid as compared with the 
weak acid  
• A strong acid reacts faster than a weak acid  
• This is also because there is a greater concentration of hydrogen ions in the strong acid 
compared with the weak acid  
Strong and weak bases 
• All hydroxides of alkali metals are strong bases. Strong bases are completely ionised in water  
• Ammonia is a weak base because it is only partly ionised in water 
• Compared with strong bases, weak bases have: 
i. 
A lower electrical conductivity  
ii. 
A less alkaline (lower) pH 
iii. 
A slower rate of reaction  
 
 
 
 
 

Oxides 
• Oxides are compounds of metals or non-metals with oxygen  
Basic oxides 
• Most metal oxides are basic oxides 
•  Many basic oxides are formed by the direct combination of a metal with oxygen 
• Basic oxides react with acids to form a salt and water 
𝐶𝑎𝐶𝑂 (𝑠) + 2𝐻𝐶𝑙(𝑎𝑞) →𝐶𝑎𝐶𝑙2(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
• Basix oxides do not react with alkalis 
• Many basic oxides do not react with water 
• But those from Group I and many from Group II in the Periodic table form a metal hydroxide 
• An alkaline solution is formed which turns red litmus blue  
𝐵𝑎𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) →𝐵𝑎(𝑂𝐻)2 
Acidic oxides 
• Most non-metal oxides are acidic oxides. Many are formed by direct reaction with oxygen  
• Acidic oxides react with alkalis to form a salt and water  
𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) + 2𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎2𝐶𝑂3(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
• Some acidic oxides react with bases such as metal oxides when heated 
𝑆𝑖𝑂2 + 𝐶𝑎𝑂→𝐶𝑎𝑆𝑖𝑂3 
• Many acidic oxides react with water to form acidic solutions 
𝑆𝑂3(𝑔) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) →𝐻2𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) 
Neutral oxides 
• Neutral oxides do not react with acids or bases  
• Examples of neutral oxides are: nitrogen (I) oxide, 𝑁2𝑂 nitrogen oxide, NO, and carbon monoxide 
CO. 
• Most are lower oxides of non-metals 
• Example: carbon monoxide is a neutral oxide but carbon dioxide is an acidic oxide 
Amphoteric oxides 
• Amphoteric oxides have both acidic and basic oxides 
• The oxides of aluminium and zinc are examples 
• They form salts when they react with acids 
• They react with alkalis to form complex salts 
𝑍𝑛𝑂(𝑠) + 2𝐻𝑁𝑂3(𝑎𝑞) →𝑍𝑛(𝑁𝑂3)2(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
𝑍𝑛𝑂(𝑠) + 2𝑁𝑎𝑂𝐻(𝑎𝑞) →𝑁𝑎2𝑍𝑛𝑂2(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙)

chemistry,Unit 11 Making and identifying salts,"Making and identifying salts 
How do we make salts? 
• Reacting a metal with an acid 
• Reacting an insoluble base with an acid 
• Neutralizing an alkali with an acid by titration 
• By precipitation  
Salts from metals 
• This method is only suitable for metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series, such as: 
magnesium, zinc, aluminum and iron 
• It is not appropriate for metals such as copper, lead and silver as they are too close to hydrogen 
in the reactivity series 
• It is also not a good idea to prepare salts of sodium and potassium using this method as the 
reaction is too violent  
Procedure: 
1. Add the metal to the acid in a flask so that the metal is in excess. The acid is the limiting reagent. 
2. Warm the flask gently to complete the reaction  
3. Filter off the excess metal. The filtrate is a solution of the metal salt 
4. Put the filtrate into an evaporating basin and evaporate the water until crystallization point. 
Allow crystals to form at room temperature  
5. Filter off crystals and wash them with small volumes of distilled water so that they do not 
dissolve  
6. Dry between the folds of filter paper 
Salts from insoluble bases 
• We can make salts with many metals by reacting an insoluble base with an acid 
• Used for making salts of metals that are low on the reactivity series 
• For example: 
𝐶𝑢𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐻2𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) →𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) 
Titrations  
• Titration is used to make a soluble salt from a soluble base and an acid 
• This method is used to make salts of Group 1 metals and ammonium salts  
• We use an acid-alkali titration to find out how much acid is needed to react exactly with the 
solution of an alkali  
• We use an indicator to find when the acid has just reacted with the alkali (called the end point) 
• At the end point the indicator changes color. 
• The titration is first carried out with an indicator and then without any indicator  
• The acid usually goes in the burette and the alkali in the flask  
• The indicator depends on whether you use a strong or weak acid or alkali: 
o For a strong acid and alkali use any indicator  
o For a weak alkali (ammonia) we titrate with a strong acid. The indicator used is methyl 
orange which goes from orange to red when there is excess acid 

o For a weak acid, we used a strong base. The indicator used is phenolphalein which 
changes from pink to colorless when there is excess acid  
Procedure 
1. Rinse the pipette with alkali, measure a known volume of alkali into the flask using a volumetric 
pipette 
2. Add a few drops of indicator solution  
3. Rinse the burette with acid, fill burette with acid using a funnel  
4. Record the burette reading  
5. Allow acid to flow into flask, swirl the flask to mix solution until the indicator changes color 
6. Record burette reading  
𝑇𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑒= 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔−𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 
7. Repeat this 3 times, add acid drop by drop without indicator  
8. Do calculation to find the concentration of alkali using accurate titres (taken on average) 
Precipitation

• It is made by mixing 2 soluble compounds that contain the cation and anion of the insoluble salt 
you wish to make  
• The cation and anion will react to form a precipitate  
Procedure 
1. Identify the ions present in the insoluble salt 
2. Use the solubility table to choose soluble compounds including these ions

chemistry,Unit 12 The Periodic Table,"The Periodic Table 
• Elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of their proton number 
• Vertical columns are called groups 
• Horizontal rows are called periods 
• Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties, this is because they 
have the same number of valence electrons 
• Metallic character decreases across a period but increases down a group 
• Basic oxides are on the left hand side of the periodic table, acidic oxides are on the 
right hand side 
• Most metal oxides are basic oxides and most non-metal oxides are acidic oxides 
• The valency of an element is the number of electrons its atoms gain, lose or share 
when they form a compound.

Group I Metals 
• Group I metals are called the alkali metals 
• They are very reactive becayse they only have to give away 1 electron 
• They are stored in paraffin or oil because they are so reactive 
• The melting points and boiling points decrease down the group 
• The metals get softer down the group 
• There is a general increase in density down the group with the exception of sodium 
• The reaction of the alkali metals with water:

• They react with water to form a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas 
• Group I elements all react with water to produce hydrogen and a solution or 
the alkali metal hydroxide  

• The chemical reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group 
because the atoms get larger down the group so the electrostatic force 
between the electron and the positive nucleus decreases 
 
 
Group VII elements 
• Group VII elements are called halogens 
• They are poisonous non-metals that have low melting and boiling points 
• They all exist as diatomic molecules 
• The melting points and boiling points of the halogens increase down the group. 
This is the opposite to Group I metals 
• The state of the halogens at room temperature changes from gas to liquid to solid 
down the group 
• The color gets darker down the group 
• Salts when metals react with halogens are called halide 
• Reactivity decreases down the group because as the atoms get larger the 
electrostatic force between the outer shell and the nucleus decreases 
• Chlorine is a green, bromine is an orange-brown liquid and iodine is a grey solid 
• When metals react with halogens, halides salts are formed 
• Displacement reactions occur when more reactive halogens compete to form 
compounds 
 
Noble gases 
• Noble gases are found in Group 0 
• They have a full outer shell of electrons  
• They are unreactive or inert 
• They are monatomic 
• They are colorless gases 
• Helium and neon are lighter than air 
• Argon, krypton, xenon and radon are heavier than air 
• The density of the noble gases increases down the group 
• The boiling points of the noble gases increase down the group 
• Helium is used in weather balloons and airships because it is less dense than air 
• Neon is used in advertising signs because it glows red when a high voltage is 
passed through it 
• Argon is used in lightbulbs because it is inert 
• Krypton is used in lasers for eye surgery and in bulbs for car headlamps 
• Xenon is used where very bright light is required, they are also used in lasers  

Transition Elements 
• They are all metals 
• They all conduct heat and electricity 
• They are malleable and ductile 
• They are shiny and sonorous  
• They have very high melting and boiling points 
• They have very high densities 
• They are stronger and harder than Group I metals 
• They have more than one oxidation state- they have variable valency 
• They form colored compounds 
• They form complex ions 
• Many transition elements and oxides are good catalysts 
• They are less reactive than metals from other groups. They do not react with cold 
water, although some react with steam",745," Elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of their proton number . The valency of an element is the number of electrons its atoms gain, lose or share or share when they form a compound . Metallic character decreases across a period but increases down a group .

Alloys 
 
• 
We can change the properties of a metal to 
make it harder or more resistant to corrosion. This is 
done by mixing it with another metal or with a non-
metal. 
• 
A mixture of two or metals, or one or more 
metals with a non-metal is called an alloy 
• 
Atoms in a pure metal are arranged in regular 
layers, when a force is applied the layers are able to 
slide over each other. This explains why metals are 
malleable and ductile 
• 
When a metal is alloyed with a second metal, the 
different sized metal atoms make the arrangement of 
the lattice less regular. We say they disrupt the 
crystal lattice. This stops the layers of metal atoms 
sliding over each other when a force is applied. This 
is why an alloy is stronger and harder than a pure metal 
• Some alloys are known to have properties of memory as they are able to 
resume their original shape when straitened and then placed in hot water. 
These are called shape memory alloys.  
The metal reactivity series 
• Metals can be arranged in a reactivity series by comparing how easily they react 
with water, steam and hydrochloric acid 
• Only metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series will react with hydrochloric 
acid  
• Only metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series will react with water or steam  
Reacting metals with oxygen 
• Copper: does not burn but turns black on its surface 
• Iron: only burns when in powder form or as iron wool 
• Gold: does not burn at all, even as a powder 
• Magnesium: burns rapidly with a bright white light 
 
 

Reacting metals with steam or water 
• All the metals above hydrogen react with oxygen to form a metal oxide 
• Iron and lead only oxidize in powder form 
• Only the surface of copper reacts to form black copper oxide 
• If a metal does not react with cold water it may react with steam 
• If a metal reacts with cold water, a metal hydroxide and hydrogen are formed 
• If a metal only reacts with steam, a metal oxide is formed 
• Group I metals are very reactive, on reaction with water they produce hydroxide 
and hydrogen 
• Group II metals are less reactive they produce an oxide and hydrogen 
Calcium 
Reacts rapidly with water 
Copper 
No reaction with cold water or steam 
Magnesium  Reacts very slowly with cold water but reacts rapidly with steam 
Sodium  
Reacts violently with cold water  
Zinc  
Only reacts when powdered and heated strongly in steam 
 
• Metals below hydrogen do not react with cold water or steam. They do not release 
hydrogen from hydrochloric acid either. So copper, silver and gold are unreactive 
• A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from a solution of its salt 
• A more reactive metal loses its valency electrons more easily than a less reactive 
metal 
• The ease with which a metal loses its valency electrons to form ions depends on 
the distance of the valency electrons from the nucleus, the nuclear charge and the 
number of electron shells 
Reacting metals with acid 
• Only metals above hydrogen react with dilute acid 
• A metal reacts with an acid to form a metal salt and hydrogen 
Reducing metal oxides 
• Metal oxides below carbon in the reactivity series are reduced by carbon when 
heated 
• When a more reactive metal is heated with the oxide of a less reactive metal, the 
more reactive metal acts as a reductant 
• The apparent lack of reactivity of aluminum is due to an unreactive oxide layer that 
forms on its surface  
Thermal Decomposition  
• Thermal decomposition is the breakdown of a compound into two or more 
products by heat 

• The more reactive the metal, the more stable its compounds 
• Most metal hydroxides decompose to form a metal oxide and water 
• All metal nitrates decompose: 
i. 
Group I metals form a nitrite and oxygen 
ii. 
Other metals form a metal oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen 
• Nitrites of very unreactive metals decompose to for the metal, nitrogen dioxide and 
oxygen 
• The more reactive the metal, the more stable its hydroxide, carbonate or nitrate 
• When you burn Sulphur in oxygen it burns with a blue flame 
•",727," Metals can be arranged in a reactivity series by comparing how easily they react with water, steam and hydrochloric acid .

chemistry,Unit 14 Metal Extraction,"Metal Extraction 
Metals from their ores 
• A rock from which a metal can be extracted from is called an ore 
Metal extraction and the reactivity series 
• The way we extract metal from its ore depends on its position in the reactivity series 
• Carbon is used to reduce metal oxides of metals below it in the reactivity series 
• Carbon monoxide is also a good reductant 
• Metals above carbon in the reactivity series cannot be extracted from their oxides by heating 
with carbon. This is because the metal bonds to oxygen too strongly and the carbon is not 
strong enough to remove it 
• Metals more reactive than carbon are extracted by electrolysis 
• Electrolysis is used to extract metals such as aluminium, calcium and magnesium 
• It is possible to use electrolysis to extract metals less reactive than carbon. This is not done 
because much more energy is needed to carry out electrolysis compared with extraction 
using carbon 
•  
Extraction of zinc 
• The raw materials used in the extraction if zinc are: zinc blende (zinc sulphide [ZnS]), coke 
(carbon) and air 
The process of extraction is as follows: 
1. The ore is first crushed and treated to remove waster rock and impurities 
2. The zinc blende is then roasted (Strongly heated) in air to form zinc oxide: 
i. 
2𝑍𝑛𝑆(𝑠) + 3𝑂2(𝑔) →2𝑍𝑛𝑂(𝑠) + 2𝑆𝑂2(𝑔) 
3. The zinc oxide is then heated with coke (carbon) in the blast furnace 
4. A blast of air is blown into the bottom of the furnace. The excess carbon reacts with oxygen in 
the air to form carbon monoxide: 
ii. 
2𝐶(𝑠) + 𝑂2(𝑔) →2𝐶𝑂(𝑔) 
5. Higher up in the blast furnace carbon monoxide reduced zinc oxide to zinc:: 
iii. 
𝑍𝑛𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐶𝑂(𝑔) →𝑍𝑛(𝑔) + 𝐶𝑂2 (𝑔) 
6. The carbon dioxide formed can react with more carbon to reform more carbon monoxide: 
iv. 
𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) + 𝐶(𝑠) →2𝐶𝑂(𝑔) 
7. Some zinc oxide may also react directly with the carbon: 
v. 
𝑍𝑛𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐶(𝑠) →𝑍𝑛(𝑔) + 𝐶𝑂(𝑔) 
8. The zinc vapour is carried up through the furnace by the stream of carbon monoxide and 
carbon dioxide  
9. The vapour condenses in trays at the top of the furnace together with lead which is extracted 
at the same time 
10. The zinc is then purified by distillation  
 
• This method only produces only about 20% of the world’s zinc. Electrolysis of zinc sulphate 
is now preferred because it produces much purer zinc 
 
 
 

Extracting Iron  
• The main ore of iron, haematite, usually contains 60% of iron. Haematite is largely iron (III) 
oxide. We extract iron by the reduction of iron (III) oxide with carbon 
• The raw materials for making iron are haematite, coke, limestone and air.  
The chemical reaction is the blast furnace 
1. At the bottom of the furnace the coke burns in the not air blast to form carbon 
dioxide. This reaction is exothermic. The heat released helps heat the furnace. 
𝐶(𝑠) + 𝑂2(𝑔) →𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
 
2. The carbon dioxide reacts with the coke to form carbon monoxide: 
𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) + 𝐶(𝑠) →2𝐶𝑂(𝑔) 
3. The carbon monoxide reduces the iron (III) oxide to iron: 
𝐹𝑒2𝑂3(𝑠) + 3𝐶(𝑔) →2𝐹𝑒(𝑙) + 3𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
4. Most of the iron is produced this way. The iron flows to the bottom of the furnace 
and is removed as a liquid. It flows into moulds and is left to solidify  
5. In the hotter parts of the furnace carbon reduces iron (III) oxide directly  
𝐹𝑒2𝑂3(𝑠) + 3𝐶(𝑔) →2𝐹𝑒(𝑙) + 3𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
• The hot waste gases exiting from the top of the furnace are used to heat the air 
going into the furnace thus reducing energy costs 
Why we add limestone to the blast furnace 
• Haematite contains sand [silicon (IV) oxide] as a major impurity. The limestone (calcium 
carbonate) helps remove most of the impurities in the following way: 
6. The heat from the blast furnace decomposes the limestone: 
𝐶𝑎𝐶𝑂3(𝑠) →𝐶𝑎𝑂(𝑠) + 𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
7. The calcium oxide reacts with silicon (IV) oxide to form slag in the form of calcium 
silicate: 
𝐶𝑎𝑂(𝑠) + 𝑆𝑖𝑂2(𝑙) →𝐶𝑎𝑆𝑖𝑂3(𝑙) 
 
• The liquid slag runs down and forms a layer on top of the liquid iron because it has a lower 
density than iron. The slag is run off. The solid slag is used as a building material, 
particularly in road building 
Iron to Steel 
• The iron produced in the blast furnace us only about 95% pure 
• The impurities are mainly carbon but also include sulfur, silicon and phosphorus  
• The impurities make the iron brittle 
• If all impurities are removed, the iron becomes very soft. IN this condition, it is easily shaped 
but is too soft for many uses 
• Pure iron also rusts very easily 
• To make iron strong only some of the impurities are removed to produce various types of 
steel. Steel is an alloy of iron and or carbon with other metals 
Steel making 
• Steel is made using a basic oxygen converter  
• The converter is tipped to one side and molten iron and scrap iron are poured in 
• The convertor is put back into a vertical position. A water cooled tube called an oxygen lance 
is lowered into the convertor 

• Oxygen and powdered calcium oxide are blown onto the surface of the molten iron through 
the lance  
• The oxygen oxidises carbon, sulfur, silicon and phosphorus to their oxides. 
• The carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide escape from the convertor because they are gases 
• These reactions are exothermic. The heat released in these oxidation reactions keep iron 
molten. 
• Silicon and phosphorus oxides are solids. They are acidic oxides. So these react with the 
powdered calcium oxide which is basic and slag is formed 
• The slag floats on the surface of the molten iron and is removed 
• The amount of carbon in steel is controlled by the amount of oxygen blown into the impure 
iron. The longer the oxygen blast, the more carbon is removed 
• After the required amount of carbon has been removed, other elements such as chromium 
and nickel are added to make particular types of steel. 
Steel alloys 
• Mild steel is low carbon steel. It is soft, malleable and ductile. It is used to make car bodies 
and parts of machinery. It is also used for buildings and general building purposes 
• High carbon steel is used for hammers and chisels 
• Low alloy steels contain other metals such as chromium, magnesium and titanium. They are 
hard and do not stretch much. Nickel steels are used for bridges where strength is needed for 
bicycle chains. Tungsten steel is used for high speed tools because it does not change shape 
at high temperatures 
• Stainless steel are high metal alloys. They are very strong and resist corrosion, so they are 
used in the construction of pipes and towers in chemical factories. Stainless steel is also 
used to make cutlery. Surgical instruments are made from stainless steel.  
Other alloys 
• Aluminium is used for making aircraft bodies because it is lightweight and has a low density. 
Some food containers and cooking foil are made from aluminium. This is because there is an 
unreactive oxide layer that does not flake off, the oxide does not react with the acids that are 
present in many foods.  
• Zinc is used to galvanise iron or mild steel to prevent rusting, Galvanised steel is used for 
roofing because it is weather resistant.  
• Copper is used for electrical wiring and because of its high conductivity, it is also malleable 
and ductile. It is also used for the base of saucepans because of its high heat conductivity 
• Brass is stronger than copper and it does corrode. It is malleable, and an attractive colour. It 
is used to make musical instruments, door handles, ornaments and screws.",1304," Carbon is used to reduce metal oxides of metals below it in the reactivity series .

chemistry,Unit 15 Air and Water,"Air and Water 
Water: A valuable resource  
• Only 3% of water is fresh water 
• Most fresh water is locked up as ice in the Arctic and Antarctic  
• We cannot survive without water for more than a few days 
• Shortage of water can cause: harvest failure, animal death and risk of increases disease 
• Water is used un the home for drinking, cooking, washing and cleaning 
• In industry water is used as a solvent for many chemicals and as a coolant to stop industrial 
processes from getting too hot. It is also a cheap raw material for some chemical 
manufacturing processes. Water is also used for generating power either in hydro electrical 
power station or by turning into steam to drive turbines 
• In agriculture, water is used on farms for watering crops and for animals to drink 
Testing for water 
• We use anhydrous copper (II) sulphate to test for water. When we add water and white 
anhydrous copper (II) sulphate it turns blue. 
𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4(𝑠) + 5𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) →𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4 ∙5𝐻2𝑂(𝑠) 
Anhydrous copper (II) sulphate (white) + water →hydrated copper (II) sulphate (blue) 
• We can also use anhydrous cobalt chloride which changes from blue to pink when water is 
added  
𝐶𝑂𝐶𝑙2(𝑠) + 6𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) →𝐶𝑂𝐶𝑙2 ∙6𝐻2𝑂(𝑠) 
Anhydrous cobalt (II) chloride (blue) + water → hydrated cobalt (II) chloride (pink) 
• These tests show us that there is water present but it might not be pure water  
Water purification  
• Water from rivers and lakes are not pure, it contains dead animals and plants, dissolved in 
bacteria, many of which are harmful to health  
• Cholera and typhoid are just two main diseases caused by bacteria in untreated water  
• A modern water treatment plant removes insoluble materials and bacteria by filtration and 
chlorination 
• Treating water is a complex process and there are many stages: 
 
1. The water passes through metal grinds which collect objects such as twigs and leaves 
2. In the sedimentation tank, particles of solids such as soil particles settle to the bottom of the 
tank 
3. Aluminium sulphate is added to make small particles in water stick together, the particles fall 
to the bottom of the tank 
4. The water then passes through a filter made of sand and gravel or crushed coal. This 
removes any small insoluble particles that were not removed in the other tanks  
5. Chlorine is added to kill bacteria  
6. The pH of the water is adjusted and the water is run off and stored or goes directly to homes 
and factories 
• Although treated water appears clear, it still contains dissolved salts. So it is not pure

• Much of the air around us is polluted, it contains unwanted substances. The pollutants are 
dust particles and smoke as well as the gases sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Although 
these are present in small amounts, they have a big effect on our environment  
Separating the gases 
• Oxygen is used in welding, steel making and to support respiration systems in hospital 
• Nitrogen is very unreactive it is used to provide an inert atmosphere for food packaging, 
chemical processes and silicon chip production. The gases in air are separated by fractional 
distillation in liquid air: 
 
1. Water is removed from the air by passing it through a drying agent and carbon dioxide is 
removed by reacting it with sodium hydroxide solution 
2. The air is then cooled to -23°C and compressed (squashed into a small space) 
3. The cold compresses air is allowed to expand into a larger space. When it expands, the air is 
cooled. After this is repeated several times the temperature is cooled to -200°C. Most of the 
air is now liquid  
4. Argon, neon and xenon are removed easily because they are still gases under these 
condition. This leaves us with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen  
5. When the liquid air is warmed, the nitrogen boils off first because it has a lower boiling point. 
Some of the nitrogen condenses at the top of the lower distillation column leaving a mixture 
of impure oxygen and nitrogen at the bottom. The mixture is then expanded into a gas 
6. The oxygen-nitrogen mixture is then fed into the top column. The temperature is the top 
column is below the boiling point of oxygen and the above the boiling point of nitrogen. So 
the oxygen condenses at the bottom and nitrogen gas is removed at the top.  
Air pollution  
• We burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas in power stations and in the home 
• We use hydrocarbons from the distillation of petroleum for transport-in cars, train, ships and 
aircraft.  
• The gases given off when we burn fuels pollute the atmosphere and cause harmful effects in 
the environment  
• These pollutant gases are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and oxides of 
nitrogen.  

• When we burn fuels, tiny particles of solids also get into the air. These are called particulates. 
Lead dust and soot are example of particulates  
Carbon monoxide 
• 𝐶4𝐻8 + 4𝑂2 →4𝐶𝑂+ 4𝐻2𝑂 
• Carbon monoxide is the product of incomplete combustion, due to the lack of oxygen 
• Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas 
• It is colourless and odourless  
• It combines with the red pigment in the cells of the blood that carry oxygen in the body 
• Carbon monoxide poisoning prevents respiration i.e. it causes suffocation  
Lead Compounds  
• Lead was previously added to petrol to help it combust more efficiently  
• Although it is no longer used in petrol it is still present in the environment as particulates 
• This is because lead does not break down easily  
• Lead Is also found in some paints and water pipes in old houses 
• Lead is particularly hazardous if inhaled or consumed  
• Lead accumulates in our body and does not escape easily  
• Small quantities can lead to damage of the nervous system especially to brains of children  
Sulphur dioxide and acid rain  
• Rain is naturally acid due to dissolved carbon dioxide 
• However, if the rain has a pH lower than 5 the rain is called acid rain  
• Acid rain is formed when fossil fuels are burnt and the sulphur is oxidised and sulphur 
dioxide gas escapes into the atmosphere. (coal contains sulphur impurities and so does oil 
and natural gas) 
𝑆(𝑠) + 𝑂2(𝑔) →𝑆𝑂2(𝑔) 
• Volcanoes are also a natural source of sulphur dioxide, they produce about a third of the 
sulphur dioxide that pollutes the atmosphere  
• The sulphur dioxide reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulphur trioxide  
• The sulphur trioxide then reacts with water vapour in the air to form a solution of sulfuric 
acid  
S𝑂3(𝑔) + 𝐻2𝑂(𝑙) →𝐻2𝑆𝑂4(𝑎𝑞) 
 
• When the acidic water vapour condenses, acid rain is formed  
• Even if it does not rain, acidic gases in the atmosphere can dissolve on we surfaces and 
create the same effect as acidic rain, this is called dry deposition  
• Sulphur dioxide is not the only source of acid rain. Nitrogen oxides from car exhausts also 
play a part  
Adverse effects of acid rain 
• Tree leaves (especially pine trees) can no longer photosynthesise  
• Lakes and rivers become too acidic and marine life cannot survive 
• Soil may become too acidic for crop growth, reactions with acid in soil cause some minerals 
to dissolve, high concentration of minerals in soil water is also harmful to crops 
• Buildings made from rock carbonates will be eroded, especially limestone and marble 
buildings 
• Metal structures such as bridges and iron railings corrode 

 
The Nitrogen Oxide Problem 
Sources  
• Most nitrogen oxides are 
formed in car engines. High 
temperature and pressure 
causes the reaction  
• Formation of nitric oxide: 𝑁2(𝑔) + 𝑂2(𝑔) →2𝑁𝑂(𝑔) 
• Formation of nitrogen dioxide: 𝑁2(𝑔) + 2𝑂2(𝑔) →2𝑁𝑂2(𝑔) 
• High temperature furnaces 
• Thunderstorms, electric energy in lightning causes the formation of nitrogen oxides 
• Denitrification: bacterial action in soil causes conversion of nitrates to nitrogen and nitrous 
oxide 
• In the atmosphere nitrogen oxides can be converted from one another by oxidation or 
photochemical reactions 
• Nitrous oxide is more stable and remains in the atmosphere for linger  
Effects  
• Nitrogen dioxide can cause acid rain: 2𝑁𝑂(𝑔) + 𝑂2 →2𝑁𝑂2(𝑔) 
• Nitrogen oxides combine with hydrocarbons and from smog, which traps other particulates in 
it. These harmful gases and particulates cause irritation in the throat and nose 
• High levels of nitrogen oxides  have been linked to certain medical conditions such as asthma  
Catalytic converters  
• Nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons can be removed from car 
engine exhaust by catalytic converters 
• Honeycomb structures coated in a layer of metals or a mixture of metals (platinum, rhodium 
and palladium) 
• In the first part pf the catalytic convertor, metals catalyse the reaction of nitrogen oxides to 
nitrogen  
• In the second compartment carbon monoxide is converted to carbon dioxide 
• 2𝑁𝑂(𝑔) → 𝑁2(𝑔) + 𝑂2(𝑔) 
• 2𝑁𝑂2(𝑔) → 𝑁2 (𝑔) + 2𝑂2(𝑔) 
• 2𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) + 𝑂2(𝑔) →2𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
• Some of the carbon monoxide may react directly with the nitrogen oxides: 
• 2𝑁𝑂 (𝑔) + 2𝐶𝑂 (𝑔) → 𝑁2(𝑔) + 2𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
• 2𝑁𝑂2(𝑔) + 4𝐶𝑂→ 𝑁2(𝑔) + 4𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) 
• Unburned hydrocarbons may reduce the nitrogen oxides too 
• The gases now leaving the pipe are not poisonous, however, they contribute to global 
warming 
Prevention 
• Chimneys are fitting with scrubbers which contain calcium carbonate  
• Catalytic convertors fitted with honey combs which reduce harmful gases to harmless gases

Global Warming  
Greenhouse gases  
• A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs heat energy and stops heat from escaping into 
space. The main greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs 
(chlorofluorocarbons)  
• Greenhouse gases cause an increase in global warming by absorbing heat energy radiated 
from the earth’s surface 
 
Sources  
• Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas, it is mainly produced due to the burning of fossil 
fuels in power stations and cars, it is also produced in small amounts by industrial 
processes such as thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate to make cement and lime 
• Methane is produced as a result of digestion in cows and sheep, rice paddy fields and the 
decomposition of vegetation (especially ins swampy areas) 
• Nitrous oxide is produced by bacteria in soil 
• CFCs are used in refrigerators and spray cans, although this has been stopped, they mainly 
cause ozone depletion  
Effects  
If we did not have greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the earth would be very cold. The 
greenhouse effect works like this: 
• UV rays from the sun have very short wave lengths. They get through the atmosphere easily 
and are not absorbed by carbon dioxide 
• The UV rays hit the earth’s surface 
• The earth absorbs the UV rays and heats up 
• Heat energy is lost from the earth’s surface by infrared rays. (long wavelength radiation) 
• Infrared rays can also be absorbed by carbon dioxide 
• Some of the hear is re-radiated back to earth and some escapes into space 
 
• The more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere, the more heat absorbed by this 
greenhouse gas.  
 
Climate change and its results  
• Air temperature increase, leads to the melting of the polar ice caps, increase in sea levels and 
cause flooding in low-lying areas 
• Less rainfall leading to desertification and less food production 
• Violent weather conditions  
The Carbon Cycle 
• The carbon cycle keeps the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere approximately 
constant  
• The amount of carbon dioxide produced in respiration is balanced by that absorbed in 
photosynthesis  

• Burning fossil fuels and deforestation may lead to an unbalance in the carbon cycle 
How carbon dioxide gets in the atmosphere:  
• Fuels produce carbon dioxide whilst burning: 𝐶𝐻4(𝑔) + 2𝑂2(𝑔) →𝐶𝑂2(𝑔) + 2𝐻2𝑂 (𝑙) 
• Respiration: 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 +  6𝑂2 →6𝐶𝑂2 +  6𝐻2𝑂 
• Smaller amounts are produced by the breakdown of swamps and the thermal decomposition 
of limestone and bacteria 
• Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are dissolved in the oceans  
 
How carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere  
• Photosynthesis: 6𝐶𝑂2 +  6𝐻2𝑂→ 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 + 6𝐶𝑂2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prevention of rust 
Causes 
• Chemicals in the air may attack metals causing the surface to get eaten away. We call this 
corrosion  
• Rusting is the corrosion of iron and steel  
• For rusting to occur both oxygen and water are needed 
• 4𝐹𝑒 (𝑠) + 3𝑂2(𝑔) + 2𝐻2 (𝑙) →2𝐹𝑒2𝑂3 ∙𝐻2𝑂 (𝑠) 
• A layer of rust is very weak and flakes off the surface of the iron, the newly exposed surface 
begins to rust 
• Rusting is speeded up by salt  
Stopping rusting  
• Paint 
• A plastic coating 
• Metal plating (galvanising) 
• Greasing and oiling 
• Sacrificial protection  
• In sacrificial protection a more reactive metal is in contact with steel. The more reactive metal 
corrodes in preference to the steel  
• Zinc is more reactive than iron and loses electrons forming 𝑍𝑛2+ 
• If the zinc is scratched, the iron underneath will take up the lost electrons and therefore not 
oxidise 
• The same application is used in ships with the protection of steel through the sacrificial 
protection of magnesium",2259," Only 3% of water is fresh water and most fresh water is locked up as ice in the Arctic and Antarctic . We cannot survive without water for more than a few days .

Nitrogen dioxide can cause acid rain, acidity in soil is too acidic for crop growth . High levels of nitrogen oxides have been linked to certain medical conditions such as asthma .  The main greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs . Greenhouse gases cause an increase in global warming by absorbing heat energy radiated from the earth’s surface . The more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere, the more heat absorbed by this greenhouse gas .  Zinc is more reactive than iron and loses electrons forming 𝑍𝑛2++ in zinc . If the zinc is scratched, the iron underneath will take up the lost electrons . The more reactive metal is used in ships with the protection of steel through the sacrificial protection of magnesium .",Medium

Fertilisers  
• Plants need nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus to sustain their growth 
• A fertiliser is a substance added to the soil to replace elements harvested or taken up by 
plants 
• Fertilisers containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are known as NPK fertilisers. 
• A typical compound fertiliser may contain ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and 
potassium chloride 
• A single fertiliser does not contain potassium and phosphorus  
• Fertilisers are often mixtures of salts containing ammonium, potassium, nitrate and 
phosphate ions 
Making fertilisers  
• Many fertilisers contain ammonium salts. These are made by neutralising ammonia with acids 
𝑁𝐻3 + 𝐻𝑁𝑂3 →𝑁𝐻4𝑁𝑂3 
Ammonia + nitric acid →ammonium nitrate 
3𝑁𝐻3 + 𝐻3𝑃𝑂4 →(𝑁𝐻4)3𝑃𝑂4 
Ammonia + phosphoric acid → ammonium phosphate  
Displacement of ammonia from ammonium salts  
• Many fertilisers are slightly acidic 
• Crops do not grow well in acidic conditions so farmers add lime 𝐶𝑎(𝑂𝐻)2 to the soil to 
neutralise the acidity 
• Lime reacts with water in soil to form slaked lime, calcium hydroxide 
• This is alkaline, if too much lime is put on the soil it reacts with ammonium slats in fertilisers 
to release ammonia  
2𝑁𝐻4𝐶𝑙+ 𝐶𝑎(𝑂𝐻)2 →2𝑁𝐻3 + 𝐶𝑎𝐶𝑙2 + 2𝐻2𝑂 
Ammonium chloride + calcium hydroxide → ammonia + calcium chloride +water 
• The stronger alkali displaces ammonia from the ammonium salts. The ammonia escapes as a 
gas into the air and is lost from the soil 
Making ammonia  
• The Haber process is the process by which ammonia is made  
Raw Materials  
• The hydrogen for the Haber process is made from natural gas or by cracking ethane. The 
ethane is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum 
𝐶2𝐻6 → 𝐶2𝐻4 + 𝐻2 
Ethane → ethene + hydrogen  
 
𝐶𝐻4 + 𝐻2𝑂→𝐶𝑂+ 3𝐻2 
Methane + steam → carbon monoxide and hydrogen  
• The carbon monoxide is then reacted with steam to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
𝐶𝑂+ 𝐻2𝑂→𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐻2 

The Haber process 
• A mixture of nitrogen (1 volume) and hydrogen (3 volumes) is compressed 
• The compressed gases pass into a large tank called a convertor. This contains trays of iron 
catalyst. The temperature is 450°C and the pressure is 200atm. Nitrogen and oxygen combine 
𝑁2 + 3𝐻2 ↔2𝑁𝐻3 
• Understand these conditions about 15% of the nitrogen and hydrogen are converted to 
ammonia  
• The mixture is passed to a cooling chamber. The ammonia condenses here and is removed 
• The unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen are returned to the convertor. In this way they are not 
wasted 
What are the best reaction conditions? 
• The reaction to make ammonia is an equilibrium reaction 
• This means it strives to be balanced (equal number of products and reactants) 
• The yield is ammonia  
• To increase the yield we can increase the pressure because there are more reactant 
molecules than product molecules 
• High pressure conditions are expensive so 200atm is used and not higher  
• If the ammonia is taken away, more ammonia is produced 
• The forward reaction is exothermic so increased the temperature would favour the backward 
reaction  
• If we lower the temperature, there is not enough energy to activate the molecules 
• Therefore a moderate temperature of 450°C is used 
• A catalyst has no effect on the equilibrium as it speeds up both the forward and the backward 
reactions equally 
• The iron catalyst lowers the activation energy which is cost effective  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Sulfur and Sulfuric acid 
Sources 
• Mined in the United States, Mexico, Poland and Sicily 
• Found combined with metals ores: zinc blende (ZnS), galena (PbS) 
• Natural gas and petroleum also contain sulfur 
Uses 
• Manufacture of sulfuric acid 
• Vulcanising tyres (making them more flexible) 
• Making dyes 
Sulfur dioxide 
• Colourless, poisonous gas 
• Added to the atmosphere by volcanoes and burning of fossil fuels 
• Highly acidic when touching wet surfaces 
𝑆+ 𝑂2 →𝑆𝑂2 
2𝑍𝑛𝑆+ 3𝑂2 →2𝑍𝑛𝑂+ 2𝑆𝑂2 
• These two reactions provide sulfur dioxide for the production of sulfuric acid 
• It is used as a bleach during the manufacture of paper from wood pulp 
• Useful for bleaching silk, wool and straw as they are destroyed by stronger bleaches such as 
chlorine 
• Used to preserve food and drink by killing bacteria 
Sulfuric acid 
• It is a dibasic acid i.e. it produces two hydrogen ions per molecule that can react 
Uses  
• Paint and dyes 
• Cleaning metals 
• Soap and detergents 
• Fibres 
• Fertilisers 
• Plastics 
Properties 
• It reacts with metals above hydrogen to form a salt and hydrogen 
• It reacts with metal oxides to form a salt and water 
• It reacts with hydroxides to form a salt and water 
• It reacts with carbonates to form a salt, water and carbon dioxide 
• Sulfuric acid can also form hydrogensulfates by the replacement of one of the hydrogen ions 
in the sulfuric acid  
 
 
 

Manufacturing sulfuric acid 
The Contact Process 
Raw materials: sulfur, air and water  
Sources of sulfur: sulfur from beneath, sulphide ores, hydrogen sulphide from petroleum or natural 
gas 
Stages 
• A spray of molten sulfur is burned in a furnace in a current of dry air, sulfur dioxide is 
formed  
• Sulfur dioxide is cooled and reacted with the excess air in the convertor, which has four 
layers of vanadium (v) oxide catalyst. The temperature is 450°C and the pressure is 1 atm. In 
the convertor sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfur trioxide  
2𝑆𝑂2 + 𝑂2 ⇌2𝑆𝑂3 
• This reaction is exothermic, the heat is removed between each catalyst layer to keep the 
temperature quite low. The mixture leaving the tower contains between 96% and 99.5% sulfur 
trioxide  
• The sulfur trioxide is then absorbed into a 98% solution of sulfuric acid in the absorber.  
• We do not dissolve sulfuric acid directly into water as it forms a fine mist of sulfuric acid 
• The sulfur trioxide dissolves un 98% sulfuric acid to form a thick liquid called oleum 
𝑆𝑂3 + 𝐻2𝑆𝑂4 ⟶𝐻2𝑆2𝑂7 
• The oleum is mixed with a little water to make 98% sulfuric acid 
𝐻2𝑆2𝑂7 + 𝐻2𝑂 ⟶2𝐻2𝑆𝑂4 
• Some of the sulfuric acid is returned to the absorber and the rest is run off to be used as 
concentrated sulfuric acid  
The limestone industry 
Quick lime 
• When we hear limestone strongly it breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The 
common names for calcium oxide are quicklime or lime. 
𝐶𝑎𝐶𝑂3 ⟶𝐶𝑎𝑂+ 𝐶𝑂2 
Calcium carbonate → calcium oxide + carbon dioxide (Endothermic) 
• Quicklime is usually made in a furnace called a lime kiln 
• The limestone is strongly heated by a current of hot air 
• The rotation of the kiln helps the limestone mix with hot ait 
• The limestone decomposes to calcium oxide (quicklime) 
• This is removed at the bottom of the kiln 
Slaked lime 
• Slaked lime is calcium hydroxide 
• This is made from quicklime by adding water 
• The water is added slowly because the reaction is very exothermic 
𝐶𝑎𝑂+ 𝐻2𝑂⟶𝐶𝑎(𝑂𝐻)2 

• A solution of calcium hydroxide in water is limewater. This is used as a test for carbon dioxide 
Uses of limestone products 
• Limestone is used for building 
• Extraction of iron 
• Construction of roads 
• In powdered form we use it to neutralise excess acidity in soils and lakes and to make glass 
• Limestone + gypsum + clay + heat → cement 
• Cement + water + sand → mortar 
• Mortar hardens when it reacts with 𝐶𝑂2 
• Quicklime and slaked lime are used to treat acidity is soils and lakes because it is alkaline 
• Scrubbers are fitted into flues (chimneys) for desulfurization",1276," Plants need nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus to sustain their growth .

Organic chemistry 
• All organic compounds contain carbon  
• They usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well  
• A group of organic molecules with similar properties is called a homologous series 
• All alcohols have an –OH group and all carboxylic acids have a –COOH group  
• We call this group a functional group 
• A functional group is an atom or groups of atoms that gives a compound particular properties 
• Carboxylic acids behave in a different way from alcohols but each carboxylic acid has very 
similar properties

homologous series.  
Alkanes have the general formula: 𝐶𝑛𝐻2𝑛+𝑛 
Alkenes have the general formula: 𝐶𝑛𝐻2𝑛 
Where n is the number of carbons 
• The members of a homologous series have very similar chemical properties because they have 
the same functional group 

• The physical properties in a homologous series change in a regular way as the number of 
carbon atoms increase

• When we remove a hydrogen atom from an alkane chain we have a group called an alkyl group  
• Alkyl groups are named after the hydrocarbons by changing the –ane ending of the 
hydrocarbon to –yl 
• The general formula for an alkyl group is: 𝐶𝑛𝐻2𝑛+1 
Fuels  
• The fossil fuels: coal, petroleum and natural gas all contain hydrocarbons.  
• We cannot use petroleum as a fuel because it is a sticky black liquid that is difficult to set alight  
• When it does burn it produces clouds of poisonous black smoke  

• Petroleum is a mixture of many types of hydrocarbons having different lengths of carbon chain  
• Some of the chains are branched and there may even be compounds with rings of carbon atoms  
• Fractional distillation is used to separate the hydrocarbon molecules in petroleum into groups 
that have similar boiling points 
• These groups of molecules are called fractions  
• Each contains hydrocarbons having a certain range of carbon atoms  
• Apart from refinery gases, all these fractions are liquids 
• Many of these fractions are used as fuels:

Diesel  
16-20 
Diesel for cars and larger vehicles 
Fuel oil

For ships and home heating  
 
There is a variety of fuels we can use: 
• Wood- we use wood for heating and cooking. Some scientists are working to produce liquid fuel 
from very young trees 
• Biofuels- some plants such as oilseed rape and corn produce plant oils that can be modified for 
use in diesel engines. Other plants such as sugar cane and beet can be used to produce ethanol 
by the process of fermentation. Ethanol can be used as a fuel in cars  
• Solid waste- this can be burnt in some small power stations. But great care has to be taken that 
the poisonous chemicals formed in the furnace at high temperatures are not releases into the 
atmosphere  
• Methane (natural gas) - as well as being found underground, methane is also produced by 
decomposition of materials in rubbish sites. In some places, the gas can be piped out from the 
rubbish site and used for heating  
• Hydrogen- a good fuel because it releases a lot of energy per gram and is non-polluting. 
However, it is usually made by using energy from other fuels  
What makes a good fuel? 
• How much heat does it give out? Most hydrocarbon fuels give out a similar amount of energy 
per gram but hydrogen produces a lot more energy per gram 
• Is it polluting? Cola is very polluting, oil is less polluting and natural gas does not produce 
much pollution. But all these fuels produce the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide when burnt 
• Is it easy to use? Solid fuels such as coal and wood are not as easy to use as liquid fuels 
• Is it readily available? Many people are worried that the supply of petroleum and natural has will 
run out over the next 100 years 
• Is it cheap? The price depends on many things: how easy it is to extract and transport, 
availability and politics 
• Is it easy and safe to transport? Many fuels are flammable so care has to be taken when 
transporting them and using them  
 
 

Petroleum  
• The hydrocarbon fractions are separated by fractional distillation  
• The petroleum is first heated so that all the hydrocarbons present are present as gases 
• The petroleum is then fed into a tower called a fractionating column  
• The column is kept hot at the bottom but is cooler at the top 
• So there is a range of temperatures in the column  
• Near the bottom, the hydrocarbons with higher boiling points condense  
• Hydrocarbons with lower boiling points are still gases 
• These move further up the column  
• As they move up the column, each hydrocarbon condenses at the point where the temperature is 
the column falls just below the point of the hydrocarbon  
• Hydrocarbons of similar boiling points are collected as fractions  
• Some of the hydrocarbons do not condense  
• They come off as gases at the top of the column  
• These are refinery gases such as methane, ethane, propane and butane 
• In many oil refineries these are removed from the petroleum before fractionation",982," All organic compounds contain carbon and usually contain hydrogen and may contain other elements as well .

Structural isomers 
• Structural isomers are compounds with the same formula, but a different arrangement of atoms.  
Alkanes 
• Alkanes are hydrocarbons which only have a single covalent bonds in their structure. 
• We call them saturated hydrocarbons because no more atoms can be added to their molecules  
Physical properties of the alkanes 
• All alkanes are colorless gases, liquids or solids 
• The first four member of the alkane homologous series are gases at r.t.p. 
• Alkanes with 5 to 17 carbon atoms in their chains are liquids 
• Alkanes with more than 17 carbon atoms in their chains are solids 
• The boiling points of the alkanes vary in a regular way 
• You can see as the carbon chains get longer, the boiling points of the alkanes increase 
• The difference in the boiling point from one alkane to the next also gets smaller as the number of 
carbon atoms increases 
Chemical properties of the alkanes 
• Alkanes are generally unreactive compounds  
• They do not react with acids or alkalis 
• They do burn and undergo a few reactions under special conditions  
• Alkanes burn with a clean blue flame if there is plenty of oxygen or air present  
• We describe this reaction as complete combustion  
• Carbon dioxide and water are formed  

They burn in air

The reactions of alkanes with chlorine 
• One chemical that alkanes will react with is chlorine-but only under certain conditions  
• Alkanes do not react with chlorine in the dark  
• However, if we mix chlorine with an alkane in a sealed tube and keep it in bright sunlight, the 
green color of chlorine disappears 
• This is a photochemical reaction  
• We call this type of reaction a substitution reaction  
• You will notice that the acidic gas hydrogen chloride is produced. This turns damp blue litmus 
paper red 
• If we use excess chlorine we can substitute more hydrogen atoms  
• If enough chlorine is present all hydrogen atoms can be replaced by chlorine atoms 
• We can carry out similar reactions with alkanes and other halogens

Cracking alkanes 
• Cracking is the thermal decomposition of alkanes 
• Alkenes are obtained from alkanes by a process called cracking 
• Cracking involves heating vaporized alkanes in the presence of a catalyst  
• Cracking breaks down molecules into smaller ones 
• Cracking always produces some molecules with double bonds: alkenes 
• Longer chained alkanes are cracked to form a mixture of shorter-chained alkanes and alkenes 
Cracking petroleum fractions on a large scale  
• Cracking is often carried out on a large scale using a catalyst  
• The huge tank where this takes place is called a catalytic (cat) cracker 
• The vapor from the gas-oil or kerosene fractions is passed through a catalyst of silicon (IV) 
oxide and aluminum oxide at 400-500°C 
• The catalyst is a fine powder which has to be continuously recycles to the cat cracker through a 
regenerator tank  
• This frees the catalyst from any carbon deposited on its surface  
 
 

The longer-chained alkanes in the gas-oil or kerosene fractions which are less useful are broken down 
to shorter chained hydrocarbons: 
• The shorter-chained alkanes are used for petrol and very small alkanes are used for fuel  
• The alkenes can be used to make a wide variety of chemicals, including plastics 
• Hydrogen may also be formed which can be used for making ammonia or as a fuel  
Catalytic cracking is not the only type of cracking.  
• Long chained alkanes can be cracked at a high temperature without a catalyst  
• A temperature between 450°C and 800°C is used 
• This type of cracking produces a greater percentage if alkenes  
Alkenes 
• Alkenes are a homologous series of hydrocarbons whose names end in –ene 
• We call them unsaturated hydrocarbons because they have a double carbon bond 
• They do not have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms around each carbon atom 
• More atoms can be added to their molecules  
• We can test to see if a hydrocarbon is unsaturated by using aqueous bromine  
• Bromine water is a yellow/orange color 
• If the bromine water is decolorized, the hydrocarbon in unsaturated  
• All alkenes decolorize bromine water 
• If the bromine water remains the same yellow/orange color, the hydrocarbon is saturated 
Chemical properties of the alkenes 
Combustion  
• The complete combustion of alkenes produces carbon dioxide and water 
Addition reactions 
• Many of the reactions of alkenes are called addition reactions 
• In an addition reaction, two reactants add together to form only one product 
Hydrogen reacts with alkenes to form alkanes 
• This addition reaction is also called a hydrogenation reaction  
• It can also be classed as a reduction reaction  
• The reaction is carried out at 60°C with nickel as a catalyst 
• This type of reaction is used to male margarine from unsaturated vegetable oils  
• Only some of the double bonds in the vegetable oil are changed to single bonds 
• This is enough to harden the oil and make it into solid margarine 
Steam reacts with alkenes to form alcohols 
• A high temperature 300°C, and high pressure 700 atms is needed for these reactions 
• The steam is passed over a catalyst of phosphoric acid  
• This method gives a good yield of alcohol  
• Ethanol of high purity is made by this method  
 

Alcohols 
• Alcohols are a homologous series having –OH as the functional group  
• Their names all end with –ol 
• Ethanol is a colorless liquid that boils at about 78°C 
• It is miscible with water  
• Ethanol can by manufactured from: 
 
Fermentation of glucose 
• During fermentation, the enzymes in living yeast cells catalyze the breakdown of 
glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide 
• Fermentation is an exothermic reaction- heat is released 
• The ethanol is separated from the mixture by fractional distillation  
• Fermentation is used to make ethanol from corn, wine and grapes. When the % of 
ethanol reaches a certain level, or if the liquid gets too warm, the yeast stops working 
 
By hydration of ethene-the chemical way 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• The reaction is called a hydration because water molecules adds on to the ethene 
• There is no other product- so this is an addition reaction 
• A catalyst is needed, to speed up the reaction  
• A catalyst is needed, to speed up the reaction  
• It is a reversible reaction, and high pressure improves the yield of ethanol  
• The hydration is exothermic- heat is released  
• A low temperature will improve the yield, but the reaction will be too slow- so 570°C is 
chosen as a compromise 
 
 
Uses of ethanol 
• As a solvent: ethanol is used in perfumes and other cosmetics, in printing inks and glues 
• As a fuel: ethanol can be mixed with petrol or used alone as a fuel for cars. It is less polluting 
than petrol and reduces the reliance on petrol and diesel 
• It is used to male other chemicals such as esters which are used in food flavorings and in many 
cosmetics 
• In some cultures the ethanol produced by fermentation is used for making alcoholic drinks  
 
 

Ethanol to ethanoic acid 
Oxidation/Fermentation in the air: 
• Acetobacter is a group of bacteria that causes wine to go sour 
• These bacteria are naturally present in air and the surfaces around us 
• When we leave a solution of ethanol exposed to the air, enzymes from the bacterium speed up 
the conversion of ethanol to ethanoic acid 
• The reaction does not take place in the absence of oxygen 
• This reaction makes vinegar 
• Vinegar is a solution of ethanoic acid  
Acidified potassium manganate (VII) 
• Potassium manganate (VII) is a good oxidant, especially when sulfuric acid is added 
• We heat the ethanol with potassium manganate (VII) and sulfuric acid 
• We do this in a flask with a condenser in an upright position  
• We call this refluxing  
• This prevents alcohol which is very volatile from escaping  
• Other alcohols can be oxidized in the same way 
• The manganate (VII) ions are reduced, which produces a color change 
Potassium dichromate (VI) 
• Ethanol is oxidized by potassium dichromate (VI) another powerful oxidizing agent  
• There is a color change when the chromate (VI) ions are reduced 
• Potassium dichromate is used in one type of breathalyzer  
• It oxidizes any alcohol on a person’s breath and it itself reduced, changing color from orange to 
green 
Carboxylic acids 
• The carboxylic acids are a homologous series with –COOH as the functional group  
• Their names all end in –ioc acid  
Chemical properties of carboxylic acid  
• Carboxylic acids are typical weak acids 
• They are only partly ionized in water 
• The hydrogen of the –COOH group is the only one that is responsible for the acidity of 
carboxylic acids 
• Salts of ethanoic acid are named by changing the –oic to the –oate 
• They react with metals to form a salt and hydrogen 
• They react with alkalis to form a salt and water 
• They react with metal carbonates to form a salt, water and carbon dioxide  
Esters 
• 
Ethanoic acid reacts with alcohols to form compound called esters 
• 
The functional group is circled. It is called the ester linkage 
• 
Many esters have distinctive tastes and smells so they are used as artificial flavorings and fragrances",1739, Organic chemistry is the study of organic compounds: carbon compounds that originate in living things .

chemistry,Unit 19 Polymers,"Polymers 
What are polymers? 
• Plastics and proteins are macromolecules 
• Macromolecules are very large molecules made up of repeating units 
• We make plastics from lots of small molecules that join together to form long chains 
• We call the small molecules that join together monomers 
• The long-chain molecule formed by joining the monomers is called a polymer 
• The process of joining monomers together to form polymers is called polymerization  
• Polymers are often formed by addition reactions 
• We call this type of polymerization, where there are no other substances formed, addition 
polymerization 
• Poly(ethene), commonly just called polythene is a plastic that is easy to shape and quite strong  
• It is made by joining ethene monomers together  
Plastics 
• Plastics are particular types of polymers that can be molded 
• Plastics have a wide range of uses: 
i. 
Poly(ethene) for bowls, buckets, dustbins and plastic bags 
ii. 
Poly(propene) for milk crates and ropes 
iii. 
Poly(chloroethene) (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) for insulation around electrical wires and 
for rainwater pipes and gutters 
iv. 
Nylon for ropes, clothes and fishing nets  
v. 
Terylene for clothing  
• Many plastics are non-biodegradable  
• This means they are not broken down in the soil or water by micro-organisms when they are 
thrown away  
• If plastics get into drains they can block them and cause flooding 
• Plastics can kill wildlife by trapping small animals or blocking the digestive systems of animals 
and birds  that eat plastic along with their normal food 
• How can we deal with unwanted plastics? 
i. 
Put them into landfills. These fill up very quickly and use up land that could be used for 
agriculture or housing 
ii. 
Burn them- we can use the heat produced to provide electricity or heating. But many 
plastic produce poisonous gases when they burn. PVC produces acidic hydrogen 
chloride. Plastics containing nitrogen may produce toxic hydrogen cyanide. Many 
plastics when burnt at high temperatures also produce poisonous compounds called 
dioxins. It is very expensive to put filters on the furnaces used to burn plastics so this is 
rarely done 
iii. 
Recycling- some plastics can be melted and then molded to make new articles. Not all 
plastics can be recycled. The ones that can be recycled have to be sorted out, which takes 
time and money  
iv. 
Cracking- some plastics can be melted, then cracked and then re-polymerized to make 
new articles  
• Plastics has now been made biodegradable but many are not 

Polymer structure 
• To add an addition polymer you have to put the name of the monomer inside the brackets and 
put ‘poly’ in front 
• Some polymers are often called by their common names so it is not always easy to deduce the 
structure from the name of the monomer  
From monomer to polymer 
• Write down the formulae for the number of monomer units you want but change each double 
bond to a single bond 
• Draw single bonds between the monomer units 
• Put continuation bonds at either end of the chain to show that the chain carries on in the same 
way 
We can also write the structure of the polymer much more simply: 
• Draw the structure of the monomer but change the double bond to a single bond 
• Put continuation bonds at either end of the molecule  
• Put square brackets through the continuation bonds 
• Put an n at the bottom right-hand corner. This means that the unit repeats itself n times 
From polymer to monomer 
You can find the structure of the monomer from a diagram of the polymer: 
• Identify the repeating unit in the polymer and draw this  
• Ignore the brackets, the continuation bonds and the n 
• Make the single bond between the carbon atoms of the polymer into a double bond  
Polyamides and polyesters 
• We make addition polymer by joining the monomers together to make a long chain  
• No other substance is formed 
• However, many polymers such as nylon and Terylene are formed in a different way-by 
condensation polymerization 
• In condensation polymerization, the monomers react together to form the polymer and another 
product 
• The other product is usually a small such as water or hydrogen chloride 
• We say that the small molecule is eliminated 
• Condensation polymerization usually involves two different monomer, each with a different 
functional group 
• These groups react together to form the polymer 
Polyamides 
• Nylon is a typical polyamide 
• The two types of monomer that form a polyamide are carboxylic acids and amines 
• An amine is a compound with an 𝑁𝐻2 functional group 
• A carboxylic acid reacts with an amine to form an amide 

• This type of reaction, where two molecules join together and a small molecule is eliminated is 
called a condensation reaction  
• Each monomer has two functional group  
• We put the word di- in front of the names to show that there are two functional groups per 
monomer 
• Because each end of the monomer has a reactive functional group, a long chain is formed 
Polyesters 
• Terylene is a typical polyester 
•  The two types of monomer that form a polyester are carboxylic acids and alcohols 
• An ester linkage is formed",878," Plastics and proteins are macromolecules made up of repeating repeating units . We make plastics from lots of small molecules that join together to form long chains . Polymerization is called polymerization . Plastics are particular types of polymers that can be molded . Many plastics are non-biodegradable, meaning they are not broken down in the soil or water .  Many polymers such as nylon and Terylene are formed in a different way-by condensation polymerization . Each monomer has two functional groups which react together to form the polymer and another product . This type of reaction is called a condensation reaction .",Medium

Atoms, Elements and Compounds  
• The sub atomic particle in an atom are protons, neutrons, and electrons 
• A proton has a charge of +1 and a relative mass of 1 
• A neutron has no charge and a relative mass of 1 
• An electron has a charge of -1 and a negligible mass of 0. 0054 
• Atoms are neutral because they have equal numbers of protons and neutrons 
• The number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called the nucleon or atomic mass number 
• Numbers arranged in order of their proton number in the periodic table  
Elements, Compound and Mixtures 
• Elements are substances made up of one type of atom 
• A compound is a substance made up of two or more different types of atoms joined together 
• A molecule is the same or different atoms joined together by covalent bonds 
• A mixture contains two or more elements or compounds that are not chemically joined together. 
Mixtures do not have a fixed composition. The substances in a mixture can be separated by 
physical means. 
Electronic Structure 
• Electrons are arranged in shells or energy levels around the nucleus 
• Electrons spin in orbits around the nucleus constantly 
• The arrangement of electrons in shells in called electronic configuration 
• The first shell contains a maximum of 2 electrons, the second, third and fourth shell hold a 
maximum of 8 electrons 
• The electrons in the outer shell are called the valence or valency electrons 
• The valence electrons are important to determine the chemical properties of elements 
• Elements in the periodic table are grouped according to the number of valence electrons 
Isotopes 
• Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons 
• If an isotope is radioactive its nucleus is unstable and so it breaks down over a period of time (it 
decays). As it decays the nucleus gives out tiny particles or rays. We call theses isotopes: 
radioisotopes. The radiation given out by radioisotopes can be harmful 
• Although radioisotopes are harmful they are useful: 
i. 
Medicinal purposes: treatment of cancer cells, thyroid glands, for locating tumors and 
sterilizing medical equipment 
ii. 
Industrial-used to check for leaks in gas and oil pipelines and regulate the thickness of 
paper during manufacture

Natural macromolecules 
Large molecules in food 
• We need food to give us energy and to keep making new cells in our body 
• The main classes of food molecules that give us energy are carbohydrates and fats 
• Proteins are needed for growth and other essential functions 
• Proteins and some carbohydrates such as starch are macromolecules 
• Fats are large molecules which usually contain three ester linkages 
The structure of proteins 
• Proteins have the same amide linkage as nylon  
• But instead of being made from two different monomers, proteins are made up from twenty 
• These monomer are amino acids 
• All amino acids gave the amine (−𝑁𝐻2) and carboxylic acid (−𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐻) groups in common  
• The side chains in each of the 20 amino acids are different 
• When proteins are made, an amide link is formed by the reaction of the amine group of one 
amino acids with the carboxylic acid group of the next amino acid  
• This is an example of a condensation reaction  
• Water is eliminated  
• The order of the amino acids in the protein do not follow any regular pattern  
From proteins to amino acids 
• Proteins in our food are broken down to amino acids with the help of hydrochloric acid in the 
stomach 
• Enzymes catalyze this reaction  
• In the laboratory we can break down proteins to amino acids by heating them with hydrochloric 
acid  
𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛+ 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟⟶𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑜 𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑠 
• We call this a hydrolysis reaction  
• In a hydrolysis reaction, a compound reacts with water and breaks down to form two or more 
products 
• We often use acid or alkali to help the hydrolysis  
• If we use acid we call the reaction ‘acid hydrolysis’ 
• When proteins are hydrolyzed, the amide linkages are converted to carboxylic acid and amine 
functional groups- the reverse of the polymerization reaction  
• You can use paper chromatography to identify the amino acids formed by the hydrolysis of a 
protein  
Fats and soaps 
The structure of fats 
• Animal fats and vegetable oils form part of our diets 
• Oils are liquid fats 

• Oils and fats have similar structures-they are both esters 
• Esters are formed by reacting carboxylic acids with alcohols 
• We make fats and oils in a similar way, although in our bodies, the reactions are complex 
• The alcohol we use to make fats in glycerol  
• The carboxylic acids we use have long hydrocarbon chains  
• We can simplify their structure by writing them ^^^^^^^^^COOH, where ^^^^^^^^^^ is the alkyl 
group 
• We often call these long-chained carboxylic acids fatty acids 
• When we react glycerol with fatty acids, an ester linkage is formed 
• In fats and oils, the ester linkage is the same as in Terylene  
• But the units making up the fat are different 
• A long chain is not formed in Terylene, fats are not polymers 
•  Three ester linkages are usually formed when a fat or oil molecule is made 
• This is a condensation reaction because two molecules have reacted to form a larger molecules, 
and a small molecule, water has been eliminated  
Making soaps  
• we can hydrolyze fats and oils in a similar way to proteins- by using an acid 
• When we hydrolyze an ester with an acid, the reaction does not go to completion  
• This is because an equilibrium mixture is formed 
• So we hydrolyze fats with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution  
• We call this alkaline hydrolysis  
• When fats or oils are hydrolyzed using alkaline hydrolysis, a soap and glycerol are formed 
𝑓𝑎𝑡 (𝑜𝑟 𝑜𝑖𝑙) + 𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑚 ℎ𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑑𝑒→𝑠𝑜𝑎𝑝+ 𝑔𝑙𝑦𝑐𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑙 
• A soap is the sodium salt of a fatty acid. The type of soap formed depends on the fat or oil used  
Carbohydrates 
• Carbohydrate literally means carbon and water  
• So the empirical formula for a carbohydrate is: 𝐶𝑥(𝐻2𝑂)𝑦 
• But even simple carbohydrates are quite complex molecules 
• We can simplify the structure of glucose to show only those groups which react to form glucose 
polymers 
• We give the name monosaccharides to simple sugars such as glucose: mono means ‘one’ and 
saccharide means sugar  
• We can join monosaccharide monomers together to make polymers called polysaccharides 
• You can see that this is a condensation polymerization  
• The monosaccharide monomers have joined together and the water has been eliminated 
• The linkage in these sugar polymers is called a glyosidic linkage  
• The general formula for a polysaccharide made from glucose is (𝐶6𝐻10𝑂5)𝑛- glucose with water 
removed 
• Two common sugar polymers found in plants are starch and cellulose: 
❖ Starch is found in rice, pasta and potatoes. It provides us with most of the carbohydrate 
in our diet. Starch is made of glucose monomers arranged either in long chains or 
branched chains 

❖ Cellulose is found in the cell walls of plants. It is also a polymer of glucose. But the 
glucose molecules are arranged in a different way 
The hydrolysis of carbohydrates 
• When we heat polysaccharides with hydrochloric acid they are hydrolyzed to simple sugars 
• When starch is hydrolyzed the glyosidic linkages break and simple sugars are formed 
• The hydrochloric acid acts as a catalyst in the reaction  
• In our bodies, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose using different enzymes 
Identifying hydrolysis products 
• The simple sugars formed by the hydrolysis of polysaccharides can be identified using paper 
chromatography 
• Because sugars are colorless, we have to use a locating agent so they show up on a 
chromatogram 
• We spray the chromatogram with a mixture of tin (II) chloride and a chemical called N-
phenylenediamine  
• We then warm the chromatogram in an oven to develop the color 
• You cannot always identify a sugar or an amino acid from a chromatogram by simple 
chromatography  
• This is because some compounds have the same or similar Rf values 
• We overcome this by using two-dimensional chromatography: 
• We carry out the chromatography as usual  
• We allow the paper to dry hen turn it around 90° and carry out chromatography using a different 
solvent 
• Only then do we spray the chromatogram with a locating agent 
Fermentation 
• Nearly all chemical reactions in living things are catalyzed by enzymes 
• Enzymes are particular types of protein that act as biological catalysts 
• But unlike inorganic catalysts they are very sensitive to changes in temperature 
• They work best between 30°C and 40°C  
• If the temperature is too low they work more slowly 
• If the temperature is too high they lose their structure and don’t work 
• We say they are denatured 
• Most enzymes will not work above a temperature of about 50°C 
• Bacteria and yeast produce enzymes that catalyze fermentation reaction in organic materials 
• Fermentation us the breakdown of organic material with effervescence and release of heat 
• For thousands of years, ethanol has been made by fermentation  
• Ethanol is an excellent solvent and a good fuel, as well as being an important starting point for 
making other chemicals 
Fermentation of glucose 
• A wide range of vegetable material can be fermented  
• The most commonly used substances for making ethanol are sugars and starch 

• The bacteria and yeast that cause fermentation are found on the surface of many plants, as well 
as in air 
• When we carry fermentation to produce ethanol, we use a particular form of yeast so that 
unwanted reactions do not occur 
• The fermentation of glucose produces ethanol and carbon dioxide 
• The reaction tales place in the absence of air- it is anaerobic  
• The reaction will occur until about 14% ethanol is present in the mixture 
• If the ethanol concentrations gets much higher than this the yeast will die 
• The ethanol is separated from the reaction mixture by fractional distillation  
Comparing methods 
Ethanol from fermentation 
Ethanol from ethene and steam 
Simple method 
More complex method 
Needs a lot of very large tanks 
Needs smaller-scale equipment to produce the 
same amount of ethanol 
Uses a batch process: you have to start again 
from the beginning once you have removed the 
solution in the tank 
A continuous process: the ethanol is removed 
continuously and the ethene and steam are fed 
into the apparatus continuously  
Rate of reaction slow 
Rate of reaction fast 
Ethanol needs further purification by distillation 
Produces ethanol of high purity 
Uses renewable resources 
The ethene is made from a non-renewable 
resource- petroleum 
 
Ethanol as a fuel 
• Ethanol can be made by fermentation using a variety of plant sources 
• Sugar cane waste is fermented to ethanol for use as a fuel for cars 
• It is either mixed with petrol to form a fuel called a gasohol or used by itself 
• Ethanol is a cheaper fuel than petrol- it does not produce as much pollution 
• The ethanol made by fermentation comes from a renewable resource 
• It is potentially ‘carbon neutral’: the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by burning the 
ethanol is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere by sugar cane during 
photosynthesis",1531," The main classes of food molecules that give us energy are carbohydrates and fats . Fats are large molecules which usually contain three ester linkages .

chemistry,Unit 3 Structure and Bonding,"Structure and Bonding 
Ionic bonding  
• An ion is an electrically charged particle, it forms when atoms gain or lose electrons 
• Most atoms do not have a full outer shell so they react to become stable 
• Ions have the noble gas electronic structure with a complete outer shell of electrons 
• The full outer shell of 8 electrons is called a stable octet 
• The attraction between positive ions and negative ions is called ionic bonding 
• Ionic bonding happens when a metal and a non-metal react together and electrons are 
transferred  from the outer shell of the metal to the outer shell of the non-metal  
Covalent bonding 
• Covalent bonding happens when two non-metals share a pair of electrons  
• The pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding are called lone pairs 
• A double covalent bond is formed when two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms 
• A triple covalent bond is formed when three pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms 
• The valency of an atom can be defines as the number of electrons gained or lost to form a 
complete shell in an ionic or covalent bond 
Ionic vs covalent bonding 
• In ionic bonding the attractive forces between the positive and negative ions result in the 
formation of a giant ionic structure. The ions are regularly arranged in the crystal. This 
arrangement carries on in three dimensions throughout the crystal. This three-dimensional 
network is called a crystal lattice. The electrostatic attractive forces between ions act in all 
directions and are very strong. It takes a lot of energy to overcome these forces. This is why 
giant ionic structures have high melting and boiling points 
• The covalent bonds within molecules are very strong. However, the forces between the 
separate molecules are weak. These weak forces are called intermolecular forces 
• Since the forces between molecules are weak it only needs a little energy to overcome these 
forces and get the molecules to move away from each other. This is why molecular 
substances have low melting and boiling points 
• Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points because of the strong forces between 
the ions in the giant ionic lattice 
• Covalent bonds have low melting and boiling points because the intermolecular forces are 
weak 
• Ionic compounds are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents. They are soluble in 
water because the water molecules are able to separate the ions 
• Covalent bonds are insoluble in water 
• Ionic compounds only conduct electricity only when molten or when dissolved in water 
• Covalent compounds do not conduct electricity  
Giant Covalent Structures 
• There is a network of covalent bonds throughout the whole structure 
• Giant covalent structures have a rigid three dimensional network of strong covalent bonds 
throughout the crystal. It takes a lot of energy to break through these bonds. So unlike simple 
molecules, giant covalent structures have high melting and boiling points 
• Different forms of the same element are called allotropes 
 

Diamond 
• Carbon forms 4 bonds with other carbon atoms 
• Carbons link together to form a giant lattice 
• High melting and boiling points 
• Cannot be scratched easily 
• Used for cutting and drilling metal and glass 
• Form glittering colour-less crystals for jewellery  
Graphite 
• Atoms are arranged in layers 
• Each carbon atom is joined to three carbon atoms 
• These are arranged in hexagons 
• Bonding within is layers strong 
• Bonding between layers is weak 
• High melting and boiling points 
• Layers can slide over each other if force is applied 
• Slippery feel and can flake off so can be used as a lubricant 
• Graphite can drift along layers when voltage is applied 
Silicon (IV) oxide/ silicon dioxide 
• Sand is largely silicon dioxide 
• Silicon dioxide found in quartz has a similar structure to diamond 
• Each silicon atom is bonded to 4 oxygen atoms but each oxygen atom is only bonded to 2 
silicon atoms (SI𝑂2) 
Metallic Bonding 
• Metals from a third type of giant structure. The metal atoms are packed closely together in a 
regular arrangement. Because they are so close together, the valence electrons tend to move 
away from their atoms. A sea of free, delocalised electrons is formed surrounding a lattice of 
positively charged metal ions. The positively charged ions are held together by their strong 
attraction to the mobile electrons which move in between the ions. This is metallic bonding, 
the electrostatic attraction between electrons and the metal ions act in all directions.  
•  Most metals have high melting and boiling points because it takes a lot of energy to weaken 
the strong forces of attraction between the metal ions and the delocalised electrons in the 
lattice 
• Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat because when voltage is applied, the 
delocalised electrons move through the metal lattice towards the positive pole of a cell. 
Conduction of heat is due to vibration of the atoms passing on energy from one atom to the 
next. 
• Metals are malleable and ductile because of the regular arrangement of their atoms, therefore 
when a force is applied, the layers can slide over each other.",877," An ion is an electrically charged particle, it forms when atoms gain or lose electrons .

Conductors and Insulators 
Conductors 
• Conductors are substances which have a low resistance to the passage of electricity. In other 
words they allow electricity to flow through them easily. 
• Metals and graphite conduct electricity because they have mobile valence electrons in their 
structures 
• Copper is used in electrical wiring because it is a good conductor of electricity, it is ductile and 
easily purified by electrolysis  
• Thick wires carry a larger electric current than thin wires  we use very thick wires in high 
voltage power lines to reduce friction, and reduce the amount of heat energy produced.  
• Steel-cored aluminium cables are used in high voltage power lines because aluminium is a good 
conductor and steel strengthens the cable  
• Aluminium has a low density and is resistant to corrosion. 
Insulators 
• An insulator is  substance that resists the flow of an electric current, it does not conduct 
electricity  
• Insulators do not conduct electricity as they do not have mobile electrons  
• Examples include; plastics, glass, and ceramic materials  
• PVC plastics are useful insulators- they are flexible and non-biodegradable 
• Used for covering electrical wires or as short circuits in electrical equipment  
• Less useful when high current is used-heat easily melts plastic 
• Glass and ceramics are useful insulators-have high melting and boiling points 
• Used in high voltage electricity towers to keep wires from touching metal pylons or each other  
• Ceramics are not affected by water or air and can be moulded into complex shapes 
Electrolysis  
• Electrolysis is the breaking down of a 
compound using an electric current. It is 
the chemical reaction which takes place 
when an electric current is passed through 
an electrolyte. 
• An electrolyte is a substance, which 
when molten or when dissolved in water 
can conduct electricity accompanied by a 
chemical reaction 
• The electric current causes a chemical 
reaction that breaks down the ionic 
compound, i.e. it decomposes 
• An electrode is a metal rod or carbon (graphite) rod which allows electrons to enter or leave the 
electrolyte (i.e. it carries electric current to and from the electrolyte) 
• They are usually made from inert conductors, usually graphite or platinum 
• This is so that the electrodes do not react with the electrolyte or product of electrolysis  

• A cathode (-) is the metal rod connected to the negative terminal of the battery. It allows 
electrons to enter the electrolyte. A cathode is negatively charged 
• An anode (+) is the electrode which is connected to the positive terminal of the batter, it allows 
electrons to leave the electrolyte. An anode is positively charged. 
• At the cathode (-) the positive ion s accept electrons and become atoms. This is reduction 
• At the anode (+) the negative ions give up electrons to become atoms. This is oxidation 
• Oxidation takes place at the anode, and reduction at the cathode 
The Products of Electrolysis

Selective discharge  
When two different ions go to an electrode, one of them will be discharged in preference to the other. This 
is called selective discharge. The ion which is discharged depends on the following: 
i. 
Its position in the reactivity series 
ii. 
The concentration of the ion 
iii. 
The nature of the electrode

4𝑂𝐻−−4𝑒− ⟶2𝐻2𝑂+ 𝑂2 
NOTE: As the number of 𝐶𝑢2+ ions decreases during this electrolysis, the intensity of the blue colour 
will decreases (the blue colour will fade).

Using copper 
Electrolyte: aqueous copper (ii) sulphate 
Ions present: 𝐶𝑢𝑆𝑂4 →𝐶𝑢2+ + 𝑆𝑂4
2− 
𝐻2𝑂⇌ 𝐻+ + 𝑂𝐻− 
Reaction at the cathode (-) 
𝐶𝑢2+ and 𝐻+ ions are attracted to the cathode (-). 𝐶𝑢2+ is lower than 𝐻+ on the discharge series, so 
𝐶𝑢2+ will be discharged. Each 𝐶𝑢2+ ion will gain to electrons to form a copper atom. You will observe a 
reddish brown solid forming around the cathode (-). The cathode increases in size/mass. 
𝐶𝑢2+ + 2𝑒−→𝐶𝑢 
Reaction at the anode (+) 
𝑆𝑂4
2− and 𝑂𝐻− are attracted to the anode (+). None will be discharged, instead copper atoms will lose 
two electrons each to form copper (ii) ions which go into the solution. The anode decreases in 
size/mass. 
𝐶𝑢−2𝑒−→𝐶𝑢2+ 

NOTE:  The intensity of the blue colour of the solution remains the same, as when one copper ion is 
discharged at the cathode, another copper ion is formed at the electrode.  
Electroplating  
• Electroplating is used to put a thin layer of one metal on top of another metal, this is achieved by 
electrolysis 
• The object that is being electroplated, is connected to the negative pole i.e. it becomes the 
cathode (-). The object can be any metal and must be extremely clean 
• The plating metal is connected to the positive pole, i.e. it becomes the anode. Some typical metals 
used for plating are silver, gold, tin and chromium  
• The electrolyte being used is a solution of the ionic compound of the plating metal 
• Electroplating  is used for protection of metals from corrosion and improving the appearances 
of metals 
Example: electroplating with silver  
Electrodes: cathode – (nickel spoon), anode + (silver) 
Ions present: 𝐴𝑔+ 
𝐴𝑔𝑁𝑂3 →𝐴𝑔+ + 𝑁𝑂3
− 
Reaction at the cathode (-) 
𝐴𝑔+ ions are attracted to the cathode, each 𝐴𝑔+  ion gains one electron to form a silver atom, which forms 
a thin layer of the object being plated. 
𝐴𝑔+ + 𝑒−→𝐴𝑔 
Reaction at the anode (+) 
At the anode (+), each silver atom loses one electron to form a silver ion. The silver ions go into the 
solution.

Extracting aluminium from its ore  
• The more reactive the metal, the harder it is to 
break down its compounds 
• Electrolysis is a powerful way to break down 
compounds 
• Aluminium is extracted by the electrolysis of 
aluminium oxide (alumina) dissolved in molten 
cryolite. 
• The electrolyte cell consists of a steel tank with 
graphite lining on the inside and acts as the 
cathode (-) 
• The anode (+) is a series of suspended graphite 
rods in the centre of the tanks 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• The overall equation of the electrolysis is:  
2𝐴𝑙2𝑂3 →4𝐴𝑙+ 3𝑂2 
 
 
Reaction at the cathode (-) 
𝐴𝑙3+ ions go to the graphite cathode (-) where they are discharged. Each 𝐴𝑙3+ ion gains 3 electrons to 
form an aluminium atom. Molten aluminium collects at the bottom 
𝐴𝑙3+ + 3𝑒−→𝐴𝑙 
 
Reaction at the anode (+) 
𝑂2− ions are attracted to the carbon anode where they are discharged. Each oxide ions loses 2 
electrons to form an oxygen atom. 
2𝑂2−−4𝑒−→𝑂2 
NOTE:  
• Aluminium oxide has a high melting point, and is not a good conductor of electricity, so it is 
dissolved in molten cryolite to lower the temperature, and increase electrical conductivity saving 
energy and costs 
• The oxygen gas produced at the anode reacts with carbon to form carbon dioxide gas. The 
carbon anodes get eaten away during this reaction and  have to be replaced at regular 
intervals 
• Though aluminium is one of the most abundant materials on the earth’s crust, it is rather 
expensive to extract because: 
i. 
A large amount of energy is required for electrolysis 
ii. 
The carbon anodes need to be replaced regularly 
iii. 
It produces no bi-products",2166," Conductors are substances which have a low resistance to the passage of electricity .

Heat changes in chemical reactions 
Exothermic reactions 
• Reactions that give out energy to the surroundings 
• Example: burning of magnesium in air 
• The energy taken in to break the bonds in the reactants is more than the energy given out when 
new bonds are made 
• Δ𝐻= −𝑣𝑒 
Endothermic reactions 
• Reactions that take in heat from the surroundings  
• Example: photosynthesis 
• The energy taken in to break the bonds in the reactants is less than the energy given out when 
new bonds are made

Fuels and energy production  
The variety of fuels 
• A fuel is a substance that can be burnt to release energy  
• Fuels are used for heating, lighting, cooking, transportation and electricity  
• We can use a calorimeter and thermometer to compare the energy released when different fuels 
are burnt 
Fossil Fuels 
Coals  
• Formed by the decay of plants in swampy areas in the absence of oxygen. Over millions of years, 
plants remnants changed to coal. Coal is polluting, causes acid rain and contributes to global 
warming. 
Petroleum  
• A complex of mixture of compounds containing carbon and hydrogen. Formed when bodies of 
tiny animals and plants sank to the sea bed millions of years ago. Pressure from rocks formed 
above changed the ting organisms into petroleum. Petroleum is less polluting than coal but still 
contributes to global warming 
𝐶8𝐻18 + 12 1
2 𝑂2 ⟶8𝐶𝑂2 + 9𝐻2𝑂 
Petrol – 48kJ/g energy given out 
Natural Gas 
• Largely methane. Found underground trapped in layers of ice or near areas rich in petroleum. 
Natural gas is less polluting than coal but still contribute to global warming. 
𝐶𝐻4 + 2𝐻2𝑂⟶𝐶𝑂2 + 2𝐻2𝑂 
Natural gas- 55kJ/g energy given out 
Energy from reactivity 
• Many nuclear power stations use an radioisotope of uranium-235 
• Made into fuel rods and lowered into the reactor in nuclear power station 
• Uranium-235 is bombarded with high speed neutrons 
• Collisions cause nucleus of uranium-235 to split 
• Large amounts of energy released 
• More neutrons produced of lower mass (thorium and radium) 
• New neutrons collide with uranium-235 and split them  
• If not stopped, chain reactions can cause an explosion 
• Control rods are pushed into nuclear reactor to absorb excess neutrons 
• Energy given out in this reaction used as a heat up gas 
• Hot gas heats up water to form steam, steam used in generator to produce electricity 
• Produce more energy per gram than ordinary fuels and are not as polluting 

• They are difficult to dispose of and many people can be exposed to radiation if reactor has a 
leak 
Energy from electrochemical cells 
Simple electrochemical cells 
• Consists of two metals of different reactivity dipping into an electrolyte 
• The electrolyte can be an acid or an alkali or a solution of a salt 
• In commercial cells, the electrolyte is made into a paste so that the electrolyte does not leak 
How a simple electrochemical cell works 
• The more reactive metal in an electrochemical cell is better at releasing electrons 
• The more reactive metal becomes the negative electrode or negative pole of the cell  
• The electrons flow through the wire of the external circuit to the less reactive metal electrode 
• At the positive pole, or positive electrode, these electrons are released to combine with the ions 
to form atoms 
• The difference in the ability of the different metal ions to release electrons causes a voltage to be 
produced 
• This results in a flow of electrons from the negative electrode of the cell to the positive 
• The electrical circuit is completed by the movement of ions in the electrolyte 
Getting the best voltage 
• The further apart the metals are in the reactivity series, the greater the voltage 
• This is because the more reactive metal is better at releasing electrons to form ions 
• The more reactive metal in the cell is always the negative electrode 
Fuel Cells 
• Simple electrochemical cells lose their power after a time 
• This happens because one of the reactants is bulky  
• Electrical cells in car batteries are bulky-they take up a lot of space 
• Some electrochemical cells have to be recharged from time to time  
• Many substances found in electrochemical cells are harmful and difficult to dispose of safely 
• Hydrogen is a non-polluting fuel 
• When burning in oxygen only water is formed 
• We can use this reaction to supply electrical energy continuously 
• We do this by reacting hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell 
How does a fuel cell work? 
 
 
 
 
 

• A fuel cells consists of two platinum electrodes and an electrolyte 
• Platinum is coated onto a porous material that allows gases to pass through it  
• Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas are bubbled through the porous electrodes where the reactions 
take place 
• Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the negative electrode and oxygen is bubbled through the 
positive electrode  
Acidic electrolyte 
At the negative electrode the hydrogen loses electrons and forms hydrogen ions in the electrolyte: 
2𝐻2 →4𝐻+ + 4𝑒− 
The electrons released move around the external circuit to the positive electrode. At the positive 
electrode oxygen gains electrons and reacts with hydrogen ions from the acid electrolyte. 
𝑂2 + 4𝐻+ + 4𝑒−→2𝐻2𝑂 
The hydrogen ions removed at the positive electrode are replaced by those produced at the negative 
electrode. So the concentration of the electrolyte remains constant, the overall reaction is: 
2𝐻2 + 𝑂2 →2𝐻2𝑂 
Water is removed 
Alkaline electrolyte 
At the negative electrode the hydrogen reacts with the hydroxide ions in the electrolyte and forms 
water: 
2𝐻2 + 4𝑂𝐻−→4𝐻2𝑂+ 4𝑒− 
At the positive electrode oxygen gains electrons and reacts with water to form hydroxide ions: 
𝑂2 + 2𝐻2𝑂+ 4𝑒−→4𝑂𝐻− 
The hydroxide ions removed at the negative electrode are replaced by those produced at the positive 
electrode. So again the concentration of the electrolyser remains constant. The overall reaction is the 
same as for the acidic electrolyte 
Advantages of fuel cells 
• Hydrogen fuel cells are used to provide electrical power in spacecraft  
• Water produced can be used for drinking  
• Fuel cell are increasingly used instead of petrol to power cars 
• Water is the only product made-no pollutants formed 
• They produce more energy per gram of fuel than other fuels 
• They are lightweight 
• They don’t need recharging like batteries 
• Operate with high efficiency  
• Hydrogen and oxygen needed for fuel cells to operate are usually produced using fossil fuels 
present",1107," The energy taken in to break bonds in reactants is more than the energy given out when new bonds are made .

chemistry,Unit 8 Speed of Reaction,"Speed of Reaction 
Rate of reaction 
• The speed of a reaction- usually called the rate of reaction tells us how rapidly the products are 
formed from the reactants  
• Chemical companies need to know how to make their products as quickly and cheaply as 
possible 
• Knowing the rate of reaction helps them to do this  
Following the progress of a reaction 
To find the rate of reaction, we can either: 
i. 
Measure how quickly the reactants are used up 
ii. 
Measure how quickly the products are formed 
Calculating the rate of reaction depends on measuring something that changes with time, for example, 
volume of gas, mass of the reaction mixture or the amount of light transmitted through a solution  
• There are many methods for measuring rate of reaction  
• You can use any property that changes during a reaction  
• You could use a pH meter or an electrical conductivity meter if hydrogen ions are present 
• You could also record changes in pressure for reactions involving gases 
Calculating the rate of reaction 
𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑢𝑝

𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 
 
A graph of results 
 
• The slope of the curve tells you how fast the reaction is going  
• The slope keeps changing until the curve flattens out-which tells us the rate of reaction keeps 
changing  
• The curve is steepest at the start, so the reaction is fastest then (rate is greatest) 
• The curve becomes less steep as time passes, showing that that the reaction is slowing down  
• When the curve is flat, it means the reaction has stopped  
• The reaction rate is zero  
Limiting reactants  
𝑀𝑔+ 2𝐻𝐶𝑙→𝑀𝑔𝐶𝑙2 + 𝐻2 
The hydrochloric acid is the limiting reagent  
The magnesium is in excess 
 

 
 
 
Surface area and the rate of reaction 
• Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases the rate of reaction 
• Smaller particles of solid have a larger surface area than larger one with the same total volume 
• Many industrial processes cause fine powders to get into the air 
• These powders are highly combustible 
•  They burn readily in air because of their very large surface area  
Catalysts  
• A catalyst speeds up the rate of reaction but it is not used up in the reaction itself 
• A catalyst lowers the activation energy therefore lowering average costs  
• A catalyst works by allowing the reactants to get close together on its surface so less energy is 
needed to get the reaction to occur 
• Catalysts are generally used in the form of pellets or wire gauzes 
• Catalysts are usually transition metals or oxides of transition metals  
• This gives them a large surface area for the reactions to occur on  
• We only need tiny amounts of catalysts but they are often expensive 
• However, they can be used over and over again  
• More chemicals can be produced at a lower temperature with a catalyst  
Enzymes 
• Enzymes are proteins made by living cells, they are biological catalysts 
• Enzymes in yeast cells are used as a catalyst in making enzymes, enzymes made by bacteria are 
used in biological detergents  
• Enzymes work in a limited range of temperature and pH 
• If the temperature and pH is not optimal, the enzyme will denature  
Concentration affecting rate of reaction 
• Increasing the concentration of reactants increases the rate of reaction  
• Increasing the concentration of reactants increases the frequency of collision of the particles 
and so increases the reaction rate 
The collision theory  
• For a reaction to take place, there must be a collision between the reactant particles 
• But not every collision leads to reaction, some are unsuccessful  
• A successful collision is one where the colliding particles have enough energy to react  
Example: Reaction of magnesium with a solution of hydrochloric acid 
• If the temperature is increases, the particles have more energy. They move faster, collide more 
often and more of the collisions are successful  

• If the concentration of the acid is increased, it means there are more acid particles on the same 
volume. So there are more successful collisions 
• The surface area of the metal exposed is increased, by using magnesium powder. So more 
magnesium atoms are exposed, giving more successful collisions  
The collision theory and gas reactions 
In reactions between gases, the rate increases as temperature and pressure increases 
i. 
As the temperature rises, the gas molecules gain more energy and move faster 
ii. 
Increasing the pressure pushes the gas molecules closer together  
Temperature and the rate of reaction 
• The higher the temperature, the greater rate of reaction  
• When we heat up a reaction mixture, the particles gain energy. When particles gain energy they 
move faster and collide more often. The frequency of collisions is increased. This results in an 
increased rate of reaction 
• In order to react, particles must collide with a minimum amount of energy (activation energy) 
• As temperature increases, more and more particles have this minimum amount of energy when 
they collide  
• As the temperature is increased there is more chance of a collision between the reactant 
particles being successful  
• We say the number of effective collision in a given time increases as temperature increases 
Light sensitive reactions 
• Chemicals started by ultraviolet or visible light are called photochemical reactions  
Photosynthesis  
• 6𝐶𝑂2 + 6𝐻2𝑂→𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 + 6𝑂2 
• The glucose is turned into macromolecules called starch and cellulose  
• Photosynthesis is catalysed by green pigments in plants called chlorophylls  
 
 
Photography  
• The surface of black and white photographic film contains tiny crystals of silver bromide mixed 
with gelatine 
• When light shines on the film, the silver bromide is activated  
• Some of the silver bromide decomposes (breaks down) to form silver  
2𝐴𝑔𝐵𝑟→2𝐴𝑔+ 𝐵𝑟2 
• The silver appears black in colour because the particles are very small 
• In this reaction the silver ions in the silver bromide accept electrons from the bromide ions and 
become silver atoms (redox reaction) 
• The silver ions are reduced because they accept electrons and the bromide ions are oxidised 
because they lose electrons 
2𝐴𝑔+ + 2𝑒−→2𝐴𝑔 

 
2𝐵𝑟−→𝐵𝑟2 + 2𝑒− 
• The parts of the film exposed to stronger light appear black and the parts not exposed appear 
white 
• The greater the intensity of the light, the faster the reaction 
• A positive print is made by shining light through the negative onto a piece of photographic 
paper",1091," The rate of reaction tells us how rapidly the products are formed from the reactants . Chemical companies need to know how to make their products as quickly and cheaply as possible .

chemistry,Unit 9 Chemical Reactions,"Chemical Reactions 
Reversible Reactions 
• In a reversible reaction, the products can react to form the original products again  
Heating hydrated salts 
• When salt crystals have water as part of their structure we say that they are hydrated 
• We call the water in the salt, the water of crystallisation 
• When the crystals are heated the water of the crystallisation is lost 
• We are left with an anhydrous substance 
• Anhydrous means without water  
Equilibrium  
Equilibrium reactions have particular features: 
• The reactants or products must not escape from the reaction mixture, we call this is a closed 
system 
• At equilibrium the reactants are constantly being changed to products and the products are 
being changed back to reactants. We say that this is dynamic equilibrium 
• In dynamic equilibrium the concentration of reactants and products are fixed  
• At equilibrium the concentration of the reactants and products do not change  
• This is because the rate of the forward reaction is the same as the rate of the reverse reaction 
• The equilibrium can be approached from either direction  
• We can start with only the reactants or products 
• Whichever we start with, we end up with fixed concentrations of reactants and products in the 
equilibrium mixture 
• The position of equilibrium tells us how far the reaction goes in favour if the reactants or 
products 
• If the concentration of the products is greater than the concentration of the reactants we say that 
equilibrium is towards the right- it favours the products 
• If the concentration of reactants is greater than the concentration of products, we say that the 
position of equilibrium is to the left- it favours the reactants  
Shifting equilibrium  
• Catalyst do not have an effect on the position of equilibrium they speed up both the forward and 
backward reactions equally 
Changing the concentration 
• When the concentration of the reactant is increased, the equilibrium moves to the right  
• Adding more reactants unbalances the equilibrium  
• So the equilibrium moves to the right to form more products until the equilibrium is restored 
• In this way the relative concentrations of products and reactants are the same as before 
• When the concentration of a product is increases, the equilibrium moves to the left 
• Products are changed into reactants until the equilibrium is rstored 
 

Changing the pressure 
• Pressure can only affect reactions where the is a gas in the equation  
• If there are more moles of gas on the left than the right  
• An increase in pressure moves the reaction to the right 
• This happens because increasing the pressure squashes the molecules closer together, 
increasing their concentration 
• The reaction mixture tries to overcome this by moving the equilibrium to the right so that the 
overall number of molecules is reduced 
• Decreasing the pressure has the opposite effect  
• It pushes the reaction to the left 
• If there are equal volumes of gas on both sides of the equation, increasing the pressure has no 
effect  
Changing the temperature  
• If the reaction is exothermic in the forward reaction, it will be endothermic in the reverse reaction  
• So for an exothermic reaction when temperature increases, the equilibrium shifts in favour of the 
reverse reaction  
• It favours the endothermic change when heat is taken in  
• In an endothermic reaction, the opposite happens 
• Increasing the temperature moves the reaction to the right to favour the products 
• It favours the exothermic change where heat is given out",594," In a reversible reaction, the products react to form the original products again . This is because the rate of the forward reaction is the same as the reverse reaction . Catalyst do not have an effect on the position of equilibrium they speed up both the forward and reverse reactions .",Hard
business,Chapter 1-Business Actvity,"Unit 1: Understanding Business Activity 
Business Activity 
• A need is a good or service essential for living 
• A want us a good or service which people would like to have, but which is not essential for living. People’s want are unlimited 
• The economic problem-there exist unlimited wants but limited resources to produce the goods and services to satisfy those 
wants. This creates scarcity. 
• Scarcity is the lack of sufficient products to fulfil the total wants of the production 
• Factors of production are those resources needed to produce goods and services. There are four factors of production: 
1. 
Land- this includes all natural resources 
2. Labor- the number of people available to make products 
3. Capital- the finance, machinery and equipment necessary to manufacture goods 
4. Enterprise-this is the skill and risk-taking ability of the person who combines the other factors of production to 
produce a good or service 
• Unlimited wants + Limited Resources = scarcity 
• Opportunity cost is the next best alternative given up by choosing another item 
Specialization 
• Specialization occurs when people and businesses concentrate on what they are best at 
• Specialization is now very common because: 
1. 
Specialized machinery and technology are now widely available 
2. Increasing competition means that businesses need to keep costs low 
3. Most people recognize the higher living standards can result from being specialized 
• Division of labor is when the production process us split up into different tasks and each worker performs one of these tasks. It 
is a form of specialization. 
Advantages  
• Workers are trained in one task and specialize in this-this increases efficiency and output 
• Less time wasted moving from one workbench to another 
Disadvantages 
• Workers can become bored doing just one job-efficiency may fall 
• If one worker is absent and no one else can do the job, production might be stopped 
 
The Purpose of Business Activity  
• The purpose of all businesses is to combine the factors of production to make products that satisfy people’s wants. 
• Business activity therefore: 
1. 
Combines scarce factors 
2. Produces goods and services 
3. Employs people 
Added Value 
• Added value is the difference between the selling price of a product and the cost if bought in materials and components.  
• Added value is important as it is able to cover the expenses of a business and increase profitability 
• Added value can be increased by increasing the selling price but maintaining the cost of materials or reducing the cost of the 
materials and maintaining the selling price.",428, The purpose of all businesses is to combine the factors of production to make products that satisfy people’s wants . Scarcity is the lack of sufficient products to fulfil the total wants of the production . Specialization occurs when people concentrate on what they are best at .,Medium

The marketing department 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• The sales department is responsible for the sale of the product 
• The market research department is responsible for finding out customers’ needs, market changes and the 
impact of competitors’ actions 
• The promotion department deals with organising the advertising for the products 
• The distribution department transports the products to the market 
The Role of Marketing 
Marketing is not just about advertising and selling a good or service, as can be seen by the different marketing 
activities found in a marketing department. The central role of marketing is: 
• Identify customer needs 
• Satisfy customer needs 
• Maintain customer loyalty 
• Gain information about customers 
• Anticipate changes in customer needs 
If the marketing department in successful in identifying customer requirement and predicting future consumer needs, 
it should enable the business to meet one or more of the following objective: 
• Raise customer awareness of a product or service of the business 
• Increase sales revenue and profitability 
• Increase or maintain market share 
• Maintain or improve the image of products or the business 
• Target a new market or market segment 
• Enter new markets abroad 
• Develop new products or improve existing products

Understanding Market Changes 
Why customer/consumer spending patterns change: 
• Consumer tastes and fashion change 
• Changes in technology 
• Change in incomes 
• Ageing population 
 
The power and importance of changing customer needs 
If a business fails to respond to customer needs they are likely to fail. Customers are ‘king’ because as their needs 
change, it is the businesses which research and know what these changes are, and respond to them, that will be the 
ones which are successful. 
Why have some markets become more competitive? 
• Globalisation of markets 
• Transportation improvements 
• Internet or E-commerce 
How can businesses respond to changing spending patterns and increased competition? 
• Maintain good customer relationships 
• Keep improving the existing product 
• Bring out new products to keep customers’ interest 
• Keep costs low to maintain competitiveness 
What is meant by market? 
•  A market for a particular good is made up of the total number of customers and potential customers as well 
as seller for that particular good or service. 
Mass Marketing 
• Mass market is whereby there is a very large number of sales of a product. Products are designed to appeal 
to the whole market therefore advertising and promotions are intended to appeal to most customers. 
Advantages 
i. 
The sales to these markets are very large 
ii. 
The firm can benefit from economies of scale 
iii. 
Risks can be spread, as often the business will sell different variations of products to the mass 
market, and if one variety of the products fails then the other product may sell well 
iv. 
Opportunities for growth of the business due to large sale potentials 
Disadvantages 
i. 
High levels of competition between firms 
ii. 
High costs of advertising 
iii. 
Standardised products or services are produced and so may not meet the specific needs of all 
customers or potential customers, therefore leading to lost sales  

Niche Marketing 
• Niche market is a small, usually specialised, segment of a much larger market. Some products, often 
specialised products are only sold to a very small number of customers who form a very small segment of a 
much larger market 
Advantages 
i. 
Avoid competition from larger businesses 
ii. 
The needs of the consumer are directly focused upon 
Disadvantages 
i. 
Limited number of sales 
ii. 
Does not spread risk-usually specialises in one product with no alternative 
 
Market Segments 
• Market segment is an identifiable sub-group of a whole market in which consumers have similar 
characteristics or preferences 
Segmenting a market can help a business to: 
• Make marketing expenditure cost effective 
• High sales and profits due to cost effective marketing 
• Identify a market segment which is not having its needs fully met, and therefore offer opportunities to 
increase sales 
How markets are segmented: 
i. 
Socio-economic group i.e. income brackets 
ii. 
Age 
iii. 
Region or location 
iv. 
Gender

• A product orientated business is one whose main focus of activity is on the product itself 
• A market orientated business is one which carries out market research to find out consumer wants before a 
product is developed and produced 
• A marketing budget is a financial plan for the marketing of a product or product range for some specified period 
of time. It specifies how much money is available to market the product or product range for some specified 
time. It specifies how much money is available to market the product or range, so that the Marketing department

Why is market research needed? 
• Market research is the process of gathering, analysing and interpreting information about a market 
Market research is carried out to find out the likes and dislikes of the consumers, the amount they are willing to pay for 
it, the place they are willing to buy it and the methods of promotion needed to be used to advertise and distribute the 
products successfully. 
There are 2 types of information: 
• Quantitative information which answers the questions about the quantity of something  
• Qualitative information which answers questions where an opinion or judgement is necessary 
Both types are gathered as a result of: 
• Primary/Field research is the collection and collation of original data via direct contact with potential or existing 
customers, also called field research 
• Secondary/desk research is information that has already been collected and is available for us by others. 
Primary Research 
The process of primary research 
1. What is the purpose of the market research 
2. Decide on the most suitable method of research 
3. Decide on the size of sample needed and who is going to be asked 
4. Carry out the research 
5. Collate the data and analyse the results  
6. Produce a report of the findings  
Methods of primary research 
Questionnaires

Disadvantages 
• If questions are not well thought out, the answers to them will not be very accurate 
• Carrying out questionnaire can take a lot of time and money 
• Collating and analysing the results is also time-consuming 
Interviews

Advantages 
• The interviewer is able to explain any questions that the interviewee does not understand 
• Detailed information about what the interviewees like and dislike can be gathered 
Disadvantages

business,Chapter 12-The Marketing Mix,"The Marketing Mix: Product 
• The marketing mix is a term which is used to describe all the activities that go into marketing a product or service. These are 
often summarised as the four Ps. 
The Four Ps of Marketing  
• Product 
• Price 
• Place i.e. channels of distribution 
• Promotion  
• Some people also talk about packaging being a fifth P, but it falls under both product and promotion  
Types of products 
• Consumer good- these are goods which are consumed by people 
• Consumer services- these are services that are produced for people 
• Producer goods- these are goods that are produced for other businesses 
• Producer services- these are services produced for other services  
A successful product is capable of: 
• Satisfies existing needs and wants of consumers 
• Design, product, quality and reliability should be consistent with the product’s brand image 
• Capable of stimulating new wants from the consumer 
• Not too expensive (relative to price charged) 
• The first business to produce new product or introduce new changes to the original product before its competitors 
• Has something very distinctive that makes it appear different  
Product development  
1. 
Generate ideas from employees, sales department, research and development department, customer suggestions and 
competitors’ products 
2. Select the best ideas for further research  
3. Decide if the company will sell enough for the product to be a success 
4. Develop a prototype 
5. Launch the product in one part of the country to test the market 
6. Go to a full launch of the product to the whole market  
The costs and benefits of developing new products 
Benefits  
• The USP is the special feature of a product that differentiates it from the products of competitors  
• The USP will mean the business will be the first into the market with the new product 
• Diversification for the business, wider product range 
• May allow the business to expand into new or existing markets  
Costs  
• Cost of market research and analytics  
• Costs of producing trial products 
• Lack of sales if target market is wrong 
• Loss of company image due to failure to meet customer needs  
 

The importance of a brand image 
• A brand name is the unique name of the product that distinguishes it from other brands 
• Brand loyalty is when consumers keep buying the same brand again and again instead of choosing a competitor’s brand 
• Brand image is an image or identity given to a product which gives it a personality of its own and distinguishes it from 
competitors’ brands 
Branding  
• Needs advertising to reinforce brand’s quality  
• Higher quality than unbranded products 
• Always of the same standard (assured quality) 
• Unique packaging  
• Unique name (brand name) 
• Higher price than unbranded product  
• Creates a brand image (an image associated with consuming the product) 
• Encourages customers to keep buying it (brand loyalty) 
The role of packaging  
• Packaging is the physical container or wrapping for a product. It is also used for promotion and selling appeal. 
• Protect the product 
• Suitable for the product to fit in  
• Eye-catching/ attractive  
• Carries information about the product  
• Promotes the brand image 
• Easy to transport the product  
• Easy to open and use the product  
The product life cycle  
• The product life cycle describes the stages a product will pass through from its introduction, through its growth until it is 
mature and then finally its decline  
1. 
First the product is developed and the prototype is released to a small market 
2. It is then introduced or launched on to the market, sales grow slowly, informative advertising should be used 
3. Sales start to grow rapidly, persuasive advertising it used, prices are lowered slightly, profits start to be made as the 
development costs are covered  
4. Maturity, sales now increase slowly. Competition becomes more intense, pricing strategies and promotional pricing are used, a 
lot of advertising is used to maintain growth and sales, profits are at their highest point  
5. Sales have reached saturation point and stabilise at their highest point, competition is high but no new competitors. Competitive 
pricing is now used. A high and stable level of advertising is used but profits start to fall as sales are static and prices have to 
be reduced to be competitive  
6. Sales of the product will decline as new product come along or because the product has lost its appeal. The product will usually 
be withdrawn from the market when sales become so low and prices have been reduced so far it becomes unprofitable to 
produce the product. Advertising is then reduced and stopped.  

 
• The product lifecycle also depends on the type of the product and technological changes  
• Knowing the stage of the life cycle that a product is in can help a business with pricing and promotion decisions 
Extending the product life cycle  
• Use a new advertising campaign  
• Introduce a new, improved version of the old product 
• Sell through additional, different retail outlets  
• Introduce new variations of the original product  
• Sell into new markets e.g. export overseas 
• Make small changes to the product’s design, colour or packaging",876," The marketing mix is a term which is used to describe all the activities that go into marketing a product or service .

business,Chapter 13- The Marketing Mix,"The Marketing Mix: Price 
 
The role of pricing decisions in the marketing mix 
When deciding a price for an existing product or a new product it is important to consider if the price will fit into the rest of the marketing 
mix for the product. 
 
Pricing Strategies  
The price of a product is determined by its brand image, demand and supply in the market. The business must constantly monitor what its 
competitors are charging for their products to make sure prices remain competitive. A business will adopt new pricing strategies for 
several reasons: 
• To try and break into a new market 
• To try and increase market share 
• To try increase its profits 
• To make sure all its costs are covered and a particular profit is earned. 
The price businesses chose to charge for a product may not be related to the cost of manufacturing it, they may charge well above this as 
the customers may be willing to pay this price. 
 
The main methods of pricing  
Cost Plus pricing  
• Cost plus pricing is the cost of manufacturing the product plus mark up 
• Cost plus pricing involves estimating how many products will be produced and then calculating the total cost of production and 
finally adding a percentage mark up. 
• The method is easy to apply 
• You could lose profit if the selling price is higher than that of competitors  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡
𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 
× % 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑢𝑝= 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑢𝑝 
Competitive pricing 
• Competitive pricing is when the product is priced in line with or just below competitor’s prices to try and capture more of the 
market 
• Sales are likely to be high as your price is at a realistic level and the product is not under or over priced 
• In order to decide what the price to charge you will have to undertake research to find out about your competitor’s price which 
may take time and money  
Penetration pricing  
• Penetration pricing is when the price is set lower than the competitor’s prices in order to enter a new market  
• It ensures that sales are made and the new product enters the market 
• The product is sold at a low price and therefore the profit per unit sold may be low 
 
Price skimming  
• Price skimming is where a high price is set for a new product on the market  

• The price being charged is due to the novelty of the newly developed or produced item 
• The cost incurred from research and development is covered by this price  
Promotional pricing  
• This is when a product is sold at a very low price for a short period of time 
• It is useful for getting rid of unwanted stock that will not sell 
• It can help to renew interest in the building if sales are falling  
• The sales revenue will be lower because of the lower price of the item  
Psychological pricing  
• Psychological pricing would be used when you want to price the product at a low price for a set amount of time  
• This may involve charging a high price for a high quality product so high income customers wish to purchase it as a status 
symbol 
• It could involve charging a price for a product which is just below a whole number 
• Charging low prices for products being bought on a regular basis  
• Ensures sales and customer’s perception of product 
• Little sales avenue lost  
• Competitors may follow suit  
Dynamic pricing  
• Dynamic pricing happens when customers are split into two or more groups and they are charged different prices for basically 
the same product or service they have different demand levels. Firms do this because the price sensitivity of the two groups is 
different.  
• Dynamic pricing can also be used to reflect the level of demand, i.e. if demand increases then the price will be raised and at 
times of low demand then the price will be reduced. 
• Some effects of dynamic pricing are: 
i. 
Increased sales revenue 
ii. 
Increased profit 
iii. 
Ensuring all items/tickets are sold 
iv. 
High cost of constantly changing prices for businesses 
v. 
High cost for customers in terms of trying to find the best price  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aims of pricing strategies  
• Cost plus pricing: to cover costs and ensure a certain profit is made 
• Price skimming: to make high profit and recoup research and development 
costs  
• Penetration pricing: to enter new market 
• Psychological pricing: affect customer’s perceptions of products 
• Dynamic pricing: charge different prices to customers for the same 
product or service depending on time or level of demand  
• Promotional pricing: to increase sales 
• Competitive pricing: increase sales and maintain market share  

Price elasticity of demand  
• Price elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of demand to a change in price 
• How responsive the demand for a product is to changes in price is affected by how many close substitutes there are. If there 
are many close substitutes for the product then, even if its price rises only a small percentage, consumers will respond by 
buying the substitute product and so demand for the original product will fall by a larger percentage 
• Therefore if the demand for the products of a business is price elastic then it is not a good idea to raise prices unless there has 
been rising costs. 
• If the price elasticity of demand is inelastic then the business can increase revenue by increasing prices.",927," Price of a product is determined by its brand image, demand and supply in the market .

business,Chapter 15-The Marketing Mix,"The marketing mix: place 
The role of place decisions in the marketing mix 
• After deciding on the product and right price, the business has to get the product to the consumer 
• The product has to be available when and where the consumers want to buy it 
• Where consumers buy the product will affect how well the product will sell 
Distribution channels 
• A distribution channel is the means by which a product is passed from the place of production to the customer 
or retailer  
Distribution channel 1 
Producer → Consumer 
• This channel is common when selling from one manufacturer to another  
 
✓ This distribution channel is simple, involves manufacturers selling their products directly to the consumer 
✓ Suitable for certain types of agricultural products 
✓ Products can be sold by mail order catalogue or via the internet  
 
 This is usually impractical for most consumers as they do not live near a factory and it difficult to commute 
there 
 Cannot be suitable for products that cannot be easily sent by post 
 Expensive to send products by post and will not be cost effective  
Distribution channel 2 
Producer → Retailer → Consumer 
• Common where retailer is large such as a supermarket, or when products are expensive such as furniture or 
jewellery 
 
✓ Producer sells large quantities to retailers  
✓ Reduced distribution costs as compared to channel 1 
 
 No direct contact with customers  
Distribution channel 3 
Producer → Wholesaler → Retailer → Consumer 
• This distribution channel involves using a wholesaler, who performs the function of breaking bulk. Breaking 
bulk is where wholesalers buy products from manufacturers in large quantities and then divide up the stock 
into much smaller quantities for retailers to buy 
 

✓ Wholesaler saves storage space for smaller retailer and reduces storage costs 
✓ Small retailers can purchase products in small quantities from wholesaler because they have limited shelf life 
before they deteriorate  
✓ May give credit to customers so they can take the goods straight away to pay at a later date 
✓ Wholesaler may deliver to the small retailer thus saving on transport costs  
✓ Wholesaler can give advice to small retailers about what is selling well. They can also advise the manufacturer 
what is selling well 
 
 May be more expensive for the small shop to buy from a wholesaler than if they bought straight from the 
manufacturer  
 Wholesaler may not have the full range of products to sell 
 Takes longer for fresh produce to reach the shops and so it may not be as good quality 
 Wholesaler may be a long way from the small shops  
Distribution channel 4 
Producer → Agent → Wholesaler → Retailer → Consumer  
• An agent is an independent person or business that is appointed to deal with the sales and distribution of a 
product or range of products  
• The agent sells of behalf of the manufacturer  
• This allows the manufacturer to have some control over the way the product is sold to consumers  
• The agent will either put an additional amount on the price to cover their expenses or will receive a 
commission on sales  
 
✓ Manufacturer may not know the best way to sell the products in other markets and an agent can aid them in 
this  
✓ Agents will be aware of local conditions and will be in the best position to select the most effective places in 
which to sell 
 
 Less control over the way the product is sold to customers

Legal controls on marketing  
• These are measures put into place to protect the customer from business exploitation  
• Most people would say that the consumer needs to be protected as much as possible. They believe that goods 
should be as safe and as suitable for the purpose intended as possible. However, some managers believe that 
these laws add to the costs of making and selling products and this increases the prices in the shops  
• These are certain legal restrictions: 
❖ Weight and measures: retailers commit an offence if they sell underweight goods or their weighing 
equipment is inaccurate  
❖ Trade description: it is illegal to give a customer a deliberately misleading impression of a product 
❖ Sale of goods: it is illegal to sell products which have serious flaws or problems, that is they are not 
of satisfactory quality; products which are not fit for the purpose intended by the consumer 
❖ Supply of goods and services act: a service has got to be provided with reasonable skill and care 
❖ It is illegal to advertise misleading price claims 
❖ A person injured by faulty goods can take the supplier to goods and ask for compensation  
❖ The distance selling regulations allow customers a cooling-off period of seven working days- this 
means they can change their mind about purchasing a good or service  
Opportunities of entering new markets abroad  
✓ Growth potential of new markets in other countries 
✓ Home markets might be saturated and these new markets give the chance for higher sales 
✓ There is wider choice of location to produce products and this encourages businesses to sell as well as 
produce in these countries 
✓ Trade barriers have been lowered in many parts of the world making it easier and profitable to now enter 
these markets  
 

 
Problems when entering new markets abroad 
 Lack of knowledge  
 Cultural differences 
  Exchange rate changes 
 Import restrictions 
 Increased risk of non-payment 
 Increased transport costs  
Methods to overcome problems of entering new markets abroad  
• Joint ventures 
• Licensing  
• International franchising  
• Localising existing brands (think local-act local)",495, Marketing Strategy is a plan to combine the right combination of the four elements of the marketing mix for a product or service to achieve a particular marketing objective(s) Marketing objectives could include:  Increase sales on an existing product/service by selling into new or selling more to the existing  market .,Hard
business,Chapter 17-Production of Goods and Services,"Production of goods and services 
Managing resources effectively to produce goods and services 
• Production is the provision of a product or service to satisfy customer wants and needs. This process involves 
the firm adding value to a product 
• The production process applies to manufacturing and service industry as well 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• For a business to be competitive it should combine these inputs of resources efficiently so that the business 
makes the best use of resources at its disposal to keep costs low and increase profits 
• Labour intensive – where businesses employ more workers and less machinery 
• Capital intensive – where businesses use more machinery than employees 
Operations department 
• Role: to take inputs and change them to outputs for customer use 
• Inputs could be physical goods or services 
• The operations manager is responsible for making sure that the raw materials are provided and made into goods 
and services 
A typical manufacturing business will have: 
i. 
A factory manager responsible for the quantity and the quality of products coming off a production line, including 
the maintenance of the production line and necessary repairs 
ii. 
A purchasing manager responsible for providing the materials, components and equipment required  
iii. 
A research and development manager responsible for the design and testing of new production processes and 
products 
Productivity  
• Productivity is the output measured against the inputs used to create it  
• Can be used to measure its efficiency 
• Productivity can be measured by: 
Inputs 
(economic 
resources) 
Land 
Capital 
Labour 
Enterprise 
Production 
process 
Outputs 
Goods 
Services 

𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦= 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡
𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 
 
• Businesses usually measure the productivity of one factors of production, usually labour 
• Labour productivity can be calculated by: 
𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦= 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑎 𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒)
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑒𝑠
 
• Productivity can either mean using fewer inputs to produce the same output or using the same input to produce a 
greater output 
• The greater the efficiency, the amount produced per employee increases, so the cost of production decreases 
• Increase in productivity results in better competition  
Ways to increase productivity  
• Improve layout of machinery to reduce time wastage 
• Improving labour skills by training 
• Introducing automation 
• Improved quality control/ assurance reduces waste 
• Improve employee motivation  
• Introduce new technology  
• Improve inventory control 
• Train staff to be more efficient  
Benefits of increasing efficiency/productivity  
• Increased output relative to inputs required 
• Lower costs per unit (average cost) 
• Fewer workers may be needed, leading to lower wage costs 
• Higher wages for workers increase motivation  
Why businesses hold inventories (stock) 
• Inventories can take various forms, including raw materials, components, partly finished goods, or finished 
products ready for delivery. It can even include inventory of spare parts for machinery in case of breakdowns 
• The buffer inventory level is the inventory held to deal with uncertainty in customer demand and deliveries of 
supplies 
• When inventories reach the reorder point, they will be reordered to bring the inventory level back up to the 
maximum level. Businesses must reorder before inventories get too low to allow for time for goods to be 
delivered 
• If inventory levels get too low, they might actually run out if there is an unexpectedly high demand for the goods 

• If too high level of inventory is held then this costs a lot of money, the business has bought goods that are not 
being used, when the money could have been invested in other areas for better use 
• Effectively managing inventory levels is crucial to all business especially manufacturing and retail businesses 
 
 
 
Lean Production  
• Lean production is a term for those techniques used by businesses to cut down on waste and increase efficiency 
• Lean production cuts out any activities which do not add value to a product or service  
There are seven types of waste that can occur in production: 
1. Overproduction: producing goods before they have been ordered by customers, thus increasing storage costs and 
the chances of goods being damaged whilst in storage  
2. Waiting; when goods are not moving or being processed then waste is occurring  
3. Transportation: moving goods around unnecessarily causing waste and not adding to the value of the product. 
Goods may also be damaged during transportation  
4. Unnecessary inventory: if there is too much inventory then this takes up space and may get in the way of 
production  
5. Motion: any actions that wastes time, it may be a health or safety risk for employees. This also applies to the 
unnecessary moving around of machinery  
6. Over processing: if complex machinery is being used to complete simple tasks, then this is wasteful. Some 
activities in producing the goods may not be necessary if the design of the product is low  
7. Defects: any faults require the goods being fixed and time can be wasted inspecting the products 
Benefits of lean production 
Costs are saved through: 
• Less storage of raw materials and components 
• Quicker production of goods and services 
• No need to repair defects or provide a replacement service for a dissatisfied customer 
• Better use of equipment 
• Cutting out some processes which speed us production  
• Less money tied up in inventories 
• Improved health and safety leading to less time off work due to injury  
Reduced costs lead to lower prices for customers, businesses being more competitive and possibly also increased 
profits.  
Lean production can be achieved by the following 3 methods: 
Kaizen 
• Kaizen is a Japanese term for continuous improvement through the elimination of waste 

• The improvement does not come from investing in new technology or equipment but through ideas of the workers 
themselves 
• Small groups of workers meet regularly to discuss problems and possible solutions  
Advantages of Kaizen: 
i. 
Increased productivity 
ii. 
Reduced amount of space needed for the production process 
iii. 
Work in progress is reduced  
iv. 
Improved layout of factory, allowing some jobs to be combined permitting other employees to carry out some 
other job in the factory   
 
 
 
 
Just in time (JIT) inventory control 
• A production method that involves reducing or virtually eliminating the need to hold inventories of raw materials 
or unsold inventories of he finished product. Supplies arrive just at the time they are needed  
• The raw materials or components are delivered just in time to be used in the production process, the making of 
any part is undertaken just in time to be used in the next stage of production and the finished product is made just 
in time to be delivered to the customer  
• All this reduces the cost of holding inventory, as no raw materials and components are ordered to keep in the 
warehouse just in case it is needed 
• Warehouse space is not needed, again reducing costs 
• The finished product is sold quickly so money will come back to the business more quickly, helping its cash flow 
• The business will need a very efficient system of ordering raw materials and components and extremely reliable 
suppliers  
Cell Production 
• Whereby the production line is divided into separate, self-contained units (cells), each making an identifiable part 
of the finished product, instead of having a flow or mass production line  
• This method of production improves the morale of the employees and makes them work harder so they become 
more efficient  
• The employees feel more valued and less likely to strike or cause disruption  
 
 
Methods of production  
Job production 
• Where a single product is made at a time  
• This is where products are made specifically to order 

• Examples include: bakeries, specialist manufacturers that produce machinery to fit a specific specification such 
as bridges, ships, made to measure suits, cinema films and individual computer programs that perform 
specialised tasks  
Advantages: 
i. 
It is most suitable for personal services or one-off products 
ii. 
The product meets the exact requirements of the customer  
iii. 
The workers often have more varied jobs 
iv. 
More varied jobs increase motivation and job satisfaction 
v. 
Flexible – used for high quality goods and services meaning a higher price can be charged  
Disadvantages: 
i. 
Skilled labour is often needed  
ii. 
The costs are higher because it is often labour intensive 
iii. 
Production often takes a long time 
iv. 
Products are specifically made to order so errors can be expensive to correct  
v. 
Materials may have to specifically purchased leading to higher costs 
Batch Production 
• Batch processing is where a quantity of one product is made, then a quantity of another item will be produced 
• This is where similar products are made in blocks and batches  
• Examples include: a certain number of chairs being made and then a certain number of tables or batch of a 
particular size of jeans is produced and then a batch of another size 
Advantages: 
i. 
It is flexible way of working and production can easily be changed from one product to another  
ii. 
It still gives some variety to workers’ jobs 
iii. 
It allows more variety to products which would otherwise be identical, this gives more customer choice 
iv. 
Production may not be affected to any great extent if machinery breaks down  
Disadvantages:  
i. 
It can be expensive as semi-finished or finished products will need moving about 
ii. 
Machinery has to be rest between production batches which means there is a delay in production and output is 
lost 
iii. 
Warehouse space will be needed for stocks of raw materials and components. This is costly  
 
 
 

Flow Production  
• Flow production is where large quantities of a product are produced in a continuous process. It is sometimes 
referred to as mass production. 
• This is when large quantities of a product are produced in a continuous process 
Advantages: 
i. 
There is a high output of a standardised product 
ii. 
Costs are kept low and therefore prices are also lower 
iii. 
It is easy for capital intensive production methods to be used- reducing labour costs and increasing efficiency  
iv. 
Capital intensive methods allow workers to specialise in specific, repeated tasks and therefore the businesses 
may only need relatively unskilled workers- little training may be needed 
v. 
It may benefit from economies of scale 
vi. 
Low average costs and therefore low prices usually meaning higher sales 
vii. 
Automated production lines can operate 24 hours a day 
viii. 
Goods are produced quickly and cheaply 
ix. 
There is no need to move goods from one part of the factory to another as with batch production, so time is saved 
Disadvantages: 
i. 
It is a very boring system for employees, so there is little job satisfaction leading to a lack of motivation for 
employees 
ii. 
There are significant storage requirements- costs of inventories of raw materials/components and finished 
products can be very high  
iii. 
The capital costs of setting up the production line can be very high 
iv. 
If one machine breaks down then the whole production line will be halted  
Factors affecting which method of production to use 
• The nature of the product 
• The size of the market 
• The nature of demand 
• The size of the business  
How technology has changed production methods 
• Automation – where equipment used in the factory is controlled by a computer to carry out mechanical 
processes. The production line will mainly consist of machines and very few people to ensure that everything 
proceeds smoothly 
• Mechanism- where the production is done by machine but mainly operated by people. Robots are machines that 
are programmed to do tasks and are particularly useful in unpleasant, dangerous and difficult jobs. They are 
quick, accurate and work nonstop 24 hours a day 

• CAD (Computer aided design)- is computer software that draws items being designed more quickly and allows 
them to be rotated to see an item from all angles as opposed to drawing it several times. Used for designing new 
products, re-styling old products and when detailed technical drawings are needed 
• CAM (Computer aided manufacture) - where computers monitor the production process and control machines or 
robots on the factory floor. 
• CIM (Computer integrated manufacture) – the total integration of CAD and CAM. The computers that design the 
products are linked directly to computers that aid the manufacturing process 
• EPOS (electronic point of sale) – this is used at checkouts where the operator scans the bar code of each item 
individually 
• EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer point of sale) – this is where the electronic cash register is connected to the 
retailers’ main computer and also to banks over a wide area computer network 
Advantages of new technology: 
• Productivity is greater as new production methods are used 
• Greater job satisfaction stimulates workers, as routine is boring and done by machines 
• Types of jobs have changed as more skilled workers are required to operate machinery, businesses most offer 
training to existing workers, workers are more motivated and therefore improve the quality of their work 
• Better quality products are produced owing to better production methods and better-quality control 
• More accurate consumer demand results from computers being used to monitor inventory levels 
• Quicker communication and reduced paperwork, owing to computers, lead to increased profitability  
• The information that is available to managers is greater and this results in better and quicker decision making  
• New products are introduced as new methods of production are introduced. The market and tastes of the 
customer have changed  
Disadvantages of new technology: 
i. 
Unemployment rises and machines/computers replace people 
ii. 
Expensive to invest in, large quantities of the products have to be sold to cover purchasing costs 
iii. 
Employees are unhappy with the changes in their work practises when new technology is introduced 
iv. 
New technology is changing all the time and will often become outdated quite quickly and replaced fast if the 
business is to remain competitive",2315, Production of goods and services is the provision of a product or service to satisfy customer wants and needs .

Business Costs 
Why managers need to know the costs of operations: 
• Compared with revenue from sales to calculate whether the business will make a profit or loss 
• Helps managers make decision, for example the costs of two different locations 
• Helps managers decide which price to sell a product for 
Accurate information is therefore very important  
• Fixed costs are costs which do not vary with the number of items sold or produced in the short run. They have to be paid 
irrespective whether the business is making sales or not. They are known as overhead costs 
• Variable costs are costs which vary directly with the number of items sold or produced 
• Total costa re fixed costs bad variable costs combined 
• Average cost per unit is the total cost of production divide by total output (unit cost) 
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑)
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 (𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑)
 
Economies of Scale and Diseconomies of Scale 
Economies of scale 
• Factors that lead to a reduction in average costs as a business increases in size, there are 5 economies of scale: 
1. 
Purchasing economies- large businesses are able to get large discounts from buying in bulk and thus reducing unit costs 
2. Marketing economies- the business is able to pay for its own vehicles for distribution and advertisement 
3. Financial economies- easier to raise capital as lower rates of interest are charge due to valuable collateral available  
4. Managerial economies- large business are able to afford to hire specialist managers, increasing efficiency and lowering 
average costs 
5. Technical economies- the use of flow production and the latest equipment will reduce the average cost of large 
manufacturing businesses. In addition, some machinery is only made with a certain high output capacity. Smaller 
businesses are unable to incur the costs of purchasing, operation and maintenance of such expensive production process 
due to the lesser quantities produced and lower capital available. 
Diseconomies of scale 
• Factors that lead to an increase in average costs as the business grows beyond a certain size 
1. 
Poor communication- difficulties occur due to ineffective communication.  
2. Low morale – workers may feel unimportant and undervalued by management, it is difficult to establish relations between 
top management and workers, lack of these relations lead to low morale and low efficiency amongst workers and increase 
average costs 
3. Slow decision making- take longer for decisions to be made by managers, communicated and acted upon by all workers. 
Managers may become withdrawn from external affairs of the business and loose contact with consumers 
Break-even charts: comparing costs with revenue 
• Break-even level of output is the quantity that must be produced/sold for total revenue to equal total costs (also known as break-
even point) 
• At break-even level no loss is being made nor profit 
• Break-even charts are graphs which show how costs and revenues of a business change with sales. They show the level of sales the 
business must make in order to break even 

• The revenue of a business is the income during a period of time from the sale of goods or services.     Total revenue = quantity sold x 
price 
• The break-even point is the level of sales at which total costs = revenue 
Uses of Break-even charts 
• Shows break-even output 
• Shows safety margin 
• Helps in decision making  
• Shows area of profit or loss 
Limitations of Break-even charts 
• Assumption of no inventories and assumption of all goods being sold 
• Fixed costs are not always constant  
• Concentration solely on break-even point and not on other aspects of operations of business 
• Assumption that costs and revenues can be drawn with straight lines 
Break-even point: the calculation methods

business,Chapter 19-Achieving Quality Production,"Achieving Quality Production 
What quality means and why it is important for all businesses 
• Quality means to produce a good or service which meets customer expectations 
A business needs to try to ensure that all the products or services it sells are free from faults or defects.  
This will ensure that the business: 
i. 
Establishes a brand image 
ii. 
Builds brand loyalty 
iii. 
Maintains a good reputation  
iv. 
Helps to increase sales  
v. 
Attracts new customers 
But if quality is not maintained the business will: 
i. 
Lose customers to other brands 
ii. 
Have to replace faulty products or repeat poor service which raises costs 
iii. 
Have customers tell other people about their experiences and this may give the business a bad reputation leading 
to lower sales and profits 
Quality control 
• Quality control is the checking for the quality at the end of the production process, whether it  is the production of 
a good or service 
Advantages include: 
i. 
Tries to eliminate faults or errors before the customer receives the product or service 
ii. 
Less training required for workers 
Disadvantages include: 
i. 
Expensive as employees need to be paid to check the product or service 
ii. 
Identifies the problem but doesn’t find why the fault has occurred and therefore is difficult to remove the problem 
iii. 
Increases costs if products have to be scrapped or reworked or service repeated 
Quality Assurance 
• Quality assurance is the checking for the quality of standards throughout the production process, whether it be 
production of a product or service 
• The purpose is to ensure that the customer is satisfied, with aims of increasing greater sales, increased added 
value and increased profits 
• Attention must be paid to the design of the product, the components and the materials used, delivery schedules 
and after sales service and quality control procedures  

Advantages include: 
i. 
Tries to eliminate faults or errors before the customer receives the product or service 
ii. 
Fewer customer complaints 
iii. 
Reduced costs if products do not have to be scrapped or reworked or service repeated 
Disadvantages include: 
i. 
Expensive to train employees to check the product or service 
ii. 
Relies on employees following instructions of standard set  
Total Quality Management (TQM) 
• Total quality management is the continuous improvement of products and processes by focusing on quality at 
each stage of production 
• It tries to get it right the first time without any defects 
• Emphasis on ensuring the satisfaction of customers or counterparts in business whom tasks are being performed 
for 
• Quality should be maintained throughout the business and no faults should occur 
• TQM is linked with Kaizen through use of quality circles 
• Quality circles are where groups of workers meet regularly to discuss problems and possible solutions. Workers 
are encouraged to suggest new ideas to reduce waste and ensure zero defects  
Advantages: 
i. 
Quality is built into every part of production//becomes central to ethos of employees 
ii. 
Eliminates all errors before received by customer 
iii. 
No customer complaints and so brand image promoted leading to higher sales 
iv. 
Reduced costs as products don’t have to be scrapped/reworked or service repeated 
v. 
Waste is removed and efficiency increases 
Disadvantages: 
i. 
Expensive to train employees to check the product or service 
ii. 
Relies on employees following TQM ideology  

 
How can a customer be assured of a quality product or service? 
• Look for quality mark associated with the product or service 
• Businesses who apply quality marks have to follow certain rules to keep this marl 
• E.g. ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) allows businesses to use ISO number to advertise and in 
its literature 
• Internet sites e.g. Trip Advisor 
• Useful for business to gain good reputation from positive reviews, negative reviews have the opposite effect 
 
•Encourages everyone to thinl about quality
•Quality is the aim for all staff
•Custimers' needs are paramount 
Total Quality 
Management 
•Inspection during and after production 
•Aim is to stop faults from happening 
•Aim is to ensure products attain a pre set 
standard
•Team working and responsibility
Quality 
Assurance
•Inspectors checking finished goods
•Detection of components or products that 
are faulty
•Involves considerable waste

The role of legal controls on location decisions 
• Managers will want to locate their businesses in the best possible area, taking into account factors such as the 
cost of land, proximity to transport links and customers, availability to workers etc. 
Why do governments want to influence location decisions? 
1. To encourage businesses to set up and expand in areas of high unemployment  
2. To discourage firms from locating in overcrowded areas or sites which are noted for their natural beauty  
Two types of measures are often used by government to influence where firms locate: 
• Planning regulations will legally restrict the business activities that can be undertaken in certain areas 
• Many governments provide grants or subsidies to encourage them to locate in undeveloped parts of the country",301, The location of a business is usually considered either when the business is first setting up or when its present location proves unsatisfactory for some reason .

What do Finance Departments do? 
• Recording all financial transactions, such as payments and sales revenue 
• Preparing final accounts 
• Producing accounting information for managers 
• Forecasting cash flows 
•  Making important financial decisions  
Why do businesses need finance? 
• Revenue expenditure 
• Start-up capital  
• Capital to expand the business 
• Capital expenditure 
• Additional working capital 
 
• Start-up capital is the needed finance by a new business to pay for essential fixed and current assets before it 
can begin trading 
 
• Working capital is the finance needed by a business to pay its day-to-day costs 
 
• Capital expenditure is money spent on fixed assets which will last for more than one year 
 
• Revenue expenditure is money spent on day-to-day expenses which do not involve the purchase of a long term 
asset, for example on wages or rent 
 
Sources of Finance 
Sources of finance can be divided into two different groups:

• External finance is obtained from sources outside the of the business and separate from the business

Retained profit 
This is the profit kept in the business after the owners have taken their share of the profits, also referred to as ploughed 
back profit  
 
✓ Retained profit does not have to be repaid 
✓ There is no interest to pay 
 A new business will not have any retained profits 
 Many small firms’ profits might be too low to finance the expansion needed 
 Keeping profits in the business reduces payments to owners, for example to dividends to shareholders 
Sale of existing assets  
Existing assets that could be sold are those items of value which are no longer required by the business, for example, 
redundant buildings or surplus equipment 
 
✓ This makes better use of the capital tied up in the business 
✓ It does not increase the debts of the business 
 It may take some time to sell these assets and the amount raised is never certain until the asset is sold 
 This source of finance is not available for new business as they have no surplus assets to sell 
Sale of inventories to reduce inventory levels  
✓ This reduces the opportunity cost of high inventory levels 
 It must be done carefully to avoid disappointing customers if not enough goods are kept as inventory  
Owners’ Savings 
✓ It should be available to the firm quickly 
✓ No interest is paid 
 Savings may be too lo 
 It increases the risk taken by owners 
External Finance 
Issue of shares 
✓ This is a permanent source of capital which would not have to be repaid to shareholders 
✓  No interest has to be paid 
 Dividends are paid after tax, whereas interest on loans is paid before tax is deducted 
 Dividends will be expected by the shareholders 
  The ownership of the company could change hands if many shares are sold 

Bank loans 
A bank loan is a sum of money obtained from a bank which must be repaid and on which interest is payable  
✓ These are usually quick to arrange 
✓ They can be for varying lengths of time 
✓ Large companies are often offered low rates of interest if they borrow large sums 
 A bank loan will have to be repaid eventually and interest must be paid 
 Security or collateral is usually required 
Selling debentures 
These are long term loan certificates issued by limited companies 
✓ Debentures can be used to raise very long term finance 
 As with loans, these must be repaid and interest must be paid 
Factoring of debts  
A debtor is a customer who owes a firm money for good brought. Debt factors are specialist agencies that buy the claims 
on debtors of firms for immediate cash. 
✓ Immediate cash is made available to the business 
✓ The risk of collecting the debt becomes the factor’s and not the businesses’ 
 The firm does not receive 100% of the value of its debt 
Grants and subsidies from outside agencies 
✓ These grants and subsidies usually do not have to be repaid 
 They are often given with strings attached 
Micro-finance 
Micro-finance is the providing of financial services including small loans, to poor people not served by traditional banks 
Banks do not usually lend money to these people because: 
i. 
The size of the loans means that the bank cannot make profit from the loans 
ii. 
The people do not have assets to act as security for loans 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Short term Finance 
This provides the working capital needed by the business for the day-to-day operations, shortages of cash can be 
overcome by: 
Overdrafts 
✓ The banks gives the business the right to overdraw its account (that is spend more money than is currently in the 
account) 
✓ The firm could use this finance to pay wages or suppliers but, obviously cannot do this indefinitely  
✓ The overdraft will vary each month with the needs of the business, it is said to be a ‘flexible’ form of borrowing  
✓ Interest will only be paid on the amount that is overdrawn  
✓ Overdrafts can turn out to be cheaper than loans in the short term 
 Interests rates are variable, unlike most loans which have fixed interest rates 
 The bank can ask for the overdraft to be paid at very short notice 
Trade Credit 
This is when a business delays in paying its suppliers, which leaves the business in a better cash position  
✓ It is almost an interest-free loan to the business for the length of time that payment is delayed for  
✓ The supplier may refuse to give discounts or even refuse to supply any more goods if payment is not made quickly 
Factoring of debts 
Long term finance  
This is finance which is available for more than a year, and sometimes for many years. Usually this money would be used 
to purchase long-term fixed assets to update or expand the business or finance a takeover of another firm. 
Bank Loans 
Hire Purchase 
This allows a business to buy a fixed asset over a long period of time with monthly payments that include an interest 
charge  
✓ The firm does not have to find a large cash sum to purchase the asset  
 A cash deposit is paid at the start of the period 
 Interest payments can be quite high  
Leasing 
Leasing an asset allows a firm to utilise an asset but does not have to purchase it. Monthly leasing payments are made. 
The business could decide to purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period. Some businesses decide to sell off some 
fixed assets for cash and lease them back from a leasing company. This is called sale and leaseback.  
✓ The firm does not have to find a large cash sum to purchase the asset to start with 
✓ The care and maintenance of the asset is carried out by the leasing company 

 The total cost of leasing charges will be higher than purchasing the asset 
Issue of Shares 
• Shares ate often referred to as equities therefore the sale of shares is often called equity finance 
• Public limited companies have the ability to sell a large number of shares to the general public 
• These new issues can raise large sums, but are expensive to organise and advertise 
• Gives current shareholders the opportunity to increase proportion of current shares, maintains balance of 
ownership 
Long-term loans of debt finance 
• Loan interest is paid before tax as an expense 
• Loan interest must be paid every year, but dividends do not 
• Loans must be repaid 
• Secured against valuable assets  
Debentures 
How businesses choose their sources of finances 
1. Purpose and time period: 
i. 
If the use is long term, for example, purchasing a fixed asset, then the source should be long term 
ii. 
If the use is short term, for example, the purchase of additional inventories, then the source should be 
short term  
2. Amount needed: different sources depend on the amount of money needed  
3. Legal form and size: certain sources of finances are available to public limited companies but unavailable to sole 
traders and partners. These business often depend on personal capital and have to pay higher interest rates, 
compared to larger, well-established businesses 
4. Control: owners may loses control if they ask other people to invest in their firm  
5. Risk and gearing: the gearing of a business measures the total proportion of capital raised from long term loans, 
if this proportion is high, the business is said to be highly geared. This is a risky way of financing business. Due to 
the fact that the loans have to be repaid irrespective of whether the business is making profits or not. When 
interest rates are high and profits low, businesses may be unable to pay all the interest. The future of the 
business will be at risk. Therefore banks are reluctant to lend to highly geared businesses which may have to use 
other sources of finance.  
Will banks lend and shareholders invest? 
The chances of obtaining a loan is increased if the following are available: 
• A cash forecast is to show why the finance is needed and how it will be used 
• An income statement  
• Details of existing loans and sources of finances a 
• Evidence that collateral  
• A business plan showing clear objectives  

Shareholders are likely to invest if: 
• Share price is increasing  
• Dividends are high  
• Company has good reputation and has plans for future growth",1623," Business Finance: Needs and Sources  needs and Sources . Internal and external sources of finance can be divided into two different groups: Internal and External . Internal finance is obtained from within the business itself .

business,Chapter 22-Cash flow forecasting and working capital,"Cash flow forecasting and working capital 
• Cash is a liquid asset 
• The cash flow of a business is the cash inflows and outflows over a period of time 
• The business will experience major problems if the business runs short of cash, such as being unable to pay 
workers, being unable to produce goods and services or even lead to liquidation 
• Liquidation is whereby a business sells up everything it owns to pay for its debts 
Cash inflows 
Cash inflows are the sums of money received by a business during a period of time. Here are five of the most common 
ways of cash inflow: 
• Sale of products for cash 
• Payments made by debtors 
• Borrowing money from an external source 
• Sale of assets 
• Investors 
Cash outflows 
Cash outflows are the sums of money paid out by a business during a period of time. Here are five if the most common 
ways of cash outflow: 
• Purchasing goods or materials for cash 
• Paying wages, salaries and other expenses in cash 
• Purchasing fixed assets 
• Repaying loans 
• Paying creditors of the business 
Cash flow cycle 
A cash flow cycle shows the stages between paying out cash for labour, materials etc. and receiving cash from the sale of 
goods

The difference between cash flow and profit 
 
 
• 
Profit is the surplus 
after total costs have been 
subtracted from sales 
revenue  
• 
Can profitable 
businesses run out of cash? 
Yes-and this is a major 
reason for business failing. It 
is called insolvency 
• How is this possible: 
i. 
Allowing customers too long a credit period perhaps to encourage sales 
ii. 
Purchasing too many fixed assets at once 
iii. 
Expanding too quickly and keeping a high inventory level 
 
 
Cash flow forecasts 
A cash flow forecast is an estimate of future cash inflows and outflows of a business, usually on a month-by-month basis. 
This then shows the expected cash balance at the end of each month. A cash flow forecast can be used to tell the 
manager: 
i. 
How much cash is available for utilities, paying loans or purchasing fixed assets 
ii. 
How much the bank needs to lend to the business to avoid insolvency 
iii. 
Whether the business is holding too much cash which could be put to a more profitable use 
Uses of cash flow forecasts 
• Starting up a business 
• Running an existing business 
• Keeping the bank manager informed 
• Managing cash flow 
Calculations of cash flow forecasts 
• Opening cash or bank balance is the amount of cash held by the business at the start of the month 
• Net cash flow is the difference, each month between inflows and outflows 
• Closing cash or bank balance is the amount of cash held by the business at the end of each month. This becomes 
next month’s opening cash balance 
Cash Flow 
• 
Cash is needed to pay expenses 
• 
Cash flow is not the same as profit 
• 
Cash is received from customers, but also from bank loans and sale of 
assets and shares 
• 
Cash flow problems can occur from overtrading or giving too much credit 
• 
Cash is the most liquid asset 
• 
Lack of cash can cause a liquidity problem

• A positive net cash flow will increase the closing balance 
• A negative cash flow will reduce the bank balance 
• Each closing bank balance becomes the opening bank balance 
How can cash flow problems be overcome? 
Method of overcoming cash 
flow problem 
How it works 
Limitations 
Increasing bank loans 
Injects more cash into the business 
Interest must be paid, reducing profits. Loans will 
have to be repaid, leading to cash outflow 
Delaying payments to 
suppliers 
Cash outflows will decrease in the 
short term 
Suppliers could refuse to supply or offer low 
discounts 
Asking debtors to pay more 
quickly- insisting on only 
cash sales 
Cash inflows will increase in the 
short term 
Customers may take their custom to another 
business which offered trade credit 
Delay or cancel purchases 
of capital equipment 
Cash outflows for purchase of 
equipment will decrease 
The long term efficiency of the business could 
decrease without up-to-date equipment 
 
Long term solutions for improving cash flow 
• Attracting new investors by selling more company shares 
• Cutting costs and increasing efficiency  
• Developing new products that will attract more customers 
The importance of working capital 
Working capital is the capital available to a business in the short term to pay for day-to-day expenses 
𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙= 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠−𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 
• Working capital us the life-blood of a business 
• Having enough working capital assists in raising the credit reputation of the business 
• No business can run effectively without a sufficient quantity of working capital 
• Have an advantage of being able to buy raw materials at discounted rates, and discount/implement special 
customer orders 
Working capital maybe held in different forms: 
• Cash is needed to pay day-to-day costs and buy inventories 
• The value of a firm’s debtors is related to the volume of production and sales. To achieve higher sales there may be 
need to offer additional credit facilities 

• Having low inventories may suspend production, having to high inventories may result in opportunity costs  
 
• The overall success of a business depends upon its working capital position. So, it should be handled properly 
because it shows the efficiency and financial strength of a company",936, Cash flow of a business is the cash inflows and outflows over a period of time .

business,Chapter 23-Income Statements,"Income Statements 
What are accounts and why are they necessary? 
• Accounts are the financial records of a firm’s transactions 
• Accountants are the professionally qualified people who have the responsibility for keeping accurate accounts and 
for producing the final accounts 
• Final accounts are produced at the end of the financial year and give details of the profit and loss made over the 
year and the worth of the business 
• Limited companies are required by law to publish their final accounts 
Recording accounting transactions 
• Too long and cumbersome to be written out by hand, and so are stored on computers. Computer files store 
records of all financial transactions and information can be printed out when required

Why is profit important? 
Why profit is important 
Explanation 
Reward for enterprise 
Successful entrepreneurs have many important qualities and characteristics and 
profit gives them a reward for these 
Reward for risk taking 
Entrepreneurs and investors take considerable risks when they provide capital to a 
business-profits reward them for taking these risks by allowing payments to be 
made 
 
These payments provide incentives: to business owners to try make their business 
even more profitable; to investors to put more capital into a profitable business 
 
Source of finance 
Profits after payments to owners (retained profit) are a very important source of 
finance for the business-this allows for expansion 
Indicator of success 
When some businesses are very profitable, other businesses or new entrepreneurs 
are given a signal that investment inti producing similar goods or services would be 
profitable.  
 
Understanding income statements 
• An income statement is a document that records the income of a business and all costs incurred to earn that 
income over a period of time. It is also known as a profit and loss account  
• A gross profit is made when sales revenue is greater than the cost of goods sold 
• The sales revenue is the income to a business during a period of time from the sale of goods and services 

• The cost of goods sold is the cost of producing or buying in the goods actually sold by the business during a time 
period 
• A trading account shows how the gross profit of a business is calculated  
Gross profit 
• Gross profit is calculated before costs are considered 
𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡= 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒−𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑠 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑑 
• Gross profit does not make any allowances for overhead costs or expenses 
• Cost of goods sold is not necessarily the same as the total value of goods bought by the business 
• In a manufacturing business, rather than a retailing one, labour costs ate directly incurred in making the 
products sold and will also be deducted before arriving at the gross profit total 
• The gross profit is not the final profit for the business because of all the other expenses that have to be 
deducted  
• Costs such as salaries and utilities need to be subtracted from the gross profit 
Net profit 
• Net profit is the profit made by all businesses after all the costs have been deducted from sales revenue. It is 
calculated by subtracting overhead costs from gross profits 
• Net profit will also include any non-trading income such as rent  
• Depreciation is the fall of the value of a fixed asset over time  
• Retained profit is the net profit reinvested back into the company after deducting tax and dividends 
The income statement for limited companies will contain: 
• Corporation tax paid on the company’s net profit 
• The dividends paid out to shareholders 
• The retained profits left after these two deductions 
• Results from the previous year to allow for easy comparison",622, Accounts are the financial records of a firm’s transactions and give details of the profit and loss made over the  financial year and the worth of the business .

business,Chapter 24-Balance Sheets,"Balance Sheets 
• The balance sheet shows the value of a business’s assets and liabilities at a particular time. Sometimes referred to as 
the statement of financial position. 
• The balance sheet is different from the income statement 
• The income statement records the income and expenses of a business, and the profit and loss it makes over a set 
time period 
• The balance sheet records the value or worth of the business at one moment in time, the ned of the financial year 
Assets  
• Assets are those items of value which are owned by the business. They may be current or non-current assets 
• Non-current assets are items owned by the business for more than one year 
• Examples of non-current/fixed assets: land, buildings, equipment and vehicles  
• They are likely to be kept in the business for more than one year 
• Most fixed assets, apart from land, depreciate over time so the value of these will fall on the balance sheet from 
one year to the next 
• Intangible assets are those that do not exits physically but still have a value- such as brand names, patents and 
copyrights [intellectual property][Example of a fixed asset] 
• Current assets are owned by the business and used within one year 
• Examples of current assets: cash, inventories (stocks) and accounts receivable (debtor customers who owe 
money to the business) 
Liabilities 
• Liabilities are debts owed by the business 
• Non-current liabilities are long term debts owed by the business 
• Non-current liabilities are long term borrowings which do not have to be repaid within one year 
• Current liabilities are short-term debts owed by the business 
• Current liabilities are amounts owed by the business which must be paid within one year (bank overdrafts, 
accounts payable, suppliers/creditors owed money by the business) 
 
Why assets and liabilities are of importance 
 
• When the value of assets is greater than the value of liabilities, then wealth is owned 
• In the case of business, this wealth belongs to the owners 
• In the case of companies, it belongs to the shareholders 
• This is why the balance sheet is important to the users of the accounts  
• It shows how much wealth or equity the owners have invested in the business 
• They would obviously like to see this increase year by year 

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠−𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠
= 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟′𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟′𝑠 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦) 
 
Explanation of balance sheet terms 
• Total assets less total liabilities is always equal to total shareholders’ funds or equity-otherwise the balance sheet 
would not balance 
• Shareholder’s equity/funds is the total sum of money invested into the business by the owners of the company-
the shareholders. This money is invested in two ways: 
i. 
Share capital is the money put into the business when the shareholders bought newly issued shares 
ii. 
Reverse arise for a number of reasons. Profit and loss reverses are retained profits from current and 
previous years. This profit is owned by the shareholders but has not been paid out to them in the form of 
dividends. It is kept in the business as a part of the shareholders’ funds. 
Interpreting balance sheet data 
• Shareholders can see if their stake in the business has increased or fallen in value over the last 12 months by 
looking at the total equity figures for 2 years 
• Shareholders can also analyse how expansion by the business has been paid for-by increasing non-current 
liabilities; from retained profits or increasing share capital. If inventories or stocks have been sold off to provide 
capital for business expansion then this will be clear by this figure declining on the balance sheet 
• Working capital can be calculated from balance sheet data 
𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙= 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠−𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑦 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 
• No business can survive without working capital. It is used to pay short-term debts. If these debts cannot be paid 
because the business does not have enough working capital, the creditors could force the business to stop 
trading. 
• Capital employed can also be calculated using data from the balance sheet. 
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑑= 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑠; 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑠+ 𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 
• This is the long term and permanent capital of the business which has been used to pay for the assets of the 
business 
• Balance sheet data can also be used to calculate ratios which are used to assess business performance",731," Balance sheet shows the value of a business’s assets and liabilities at a particular time . Balance sheet records the value or worth of the business at one moment in time, the ned of the financial year . Liabilities are short-term debts owed by the business .

business,Chapter 25-Analysis of Accountants,"Analysis of Accountants 
Analysis of published account 
• Published accounts of public limited accounts are made available to stakeholders 
• Analysis of accounts means using the data contained in the accounts to make useful observations about the 
performance and financial strength of the business 
• Analyzing accounts helps the business find out whether it is performing better in the current year than the 
previous year or even performing in comparison to other business 
Ratio analysis of accounts 
• Capital employed is the shareholders’ equity plus non-current liabilities and is the total long term and permanent 
capital invested in a business 
• These ratios are used to measure and compare profitability (or performance) and liquidity of a business 
Profitability rations 
1. Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
This is calculated by the formula: 
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑑× 100 
The higher this result, the more successful the managers are in earning profit from capital used in the business  
2. Gross profit margin  
This is calculated by the formula: 
𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 (%) = 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒× 100 
This is before other expenses have been deducted and is not the final profit of the company  
 
3. Net profit margin  
This is calculated by the formula: 
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛 (%) =
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡
𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒× 100 
The concept of liquidity  
• Illiquid means that assets are not easily convertible into cash 
• Liquidity is the ability of a business to pay back its short-term debts 
• This measures a very important feature of business. If a business cannot pay its suppliers for materials that are 
important to production or if the business cannot repay an overdraft when required to, it is said to be illiquid 

 
 
Liquidity ratios 
1. Current ration 
This is calculated by the formula: 
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜=
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠  
 
A really safe current ratio would be between 1.5 and 2.if the current ratio is less than 1, it would mean that the 
business could have real cash flow problems. If the current ratio is too high, it means too much working capital is 
tied up in unprofitable current assets. 
 
2. Acid test ratio 
This is calculated by the formula: 
𝐴𝑐𝑖𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜= 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠
 
 
A result of 1 would mean that the company could just pay off its short term debts from its most liquid assets 
 
Uses and users of accounts  
 
• Managers- have more detailed and frequent accounting information than any other groups. Used by managers to keep 
control over the performance if each product or division of the business. Managers will be able to identify which parts 
of the business are performing well or poorly. Accounting data will help in decision making. 
• Shareholders and potential investors want to know from the income statement, how big a profit or loss the company 
made.  
• Creditors are other businesses which have supplied goods to the company without receiving payment. The balance 
sheet will indicate to creditors the total value of debts that the company has to pay back and the cash position of the 
company. Liquidity rations will indicate the ability of the company to pay back all of its creditors on time. 
• Banks may have lent money to the company on a short/long term basis. If the business seems to be at risk of 
becoming illiquid, it is unlikely that a bank will be willing to lend more 
• Government and tax office will want to check in the profit tax paid by the company. If the company is making a loss 
this is an indicator to the government’s control of the whole economy, especially if it means that workers’ jobs may be 
lost 
• Workers and trade unions will want to assess whether the future of the company is secure or not 
• Other businesses (especially those in the same industry), managers of other companies may be considering a bid to 
take over the company or they may just wish to compare the performance and profitability of other businesses to that 
of their own.  

Limitations of using accounts and ratio analysis 
• Managers will have access to all accounts but the external users will only be able to use the published accounts 
which only contain data required by law 
• Ratios are based on past accounting data and may not indicate how a business will perform in the future 
• Accounting data over time will be affected by inflation (rising prices), and comparisons between the years may be 
misleading  
• Different companies may use slightly different accounting methods, these lead to different ratio results, making 
comparisons difficult.",762, Analyzing accounts helps the business find out whether it is performing better in the current year than the  previous year or even performing in comparison to other business .

business,Chapter 26-Government economic objectives and policies,"Government economic objectives and policies 
Government economic objectives 
▪ Low inflation  
▪ Low unemployment  
▪ Economic growth  
▪ Balance of payments between imports and exports 
Low Inflation  
• Inflation is the increase in the average price level of goods and services over a period of time 
• Problems resulting from rapid inflation: 
i. 
Workers’ wages will not buy as many goods as before. This means that people’s real incomes (the value of income, and it falls 
when prices rise faster than money income), workers may demand higher wages so that their real incomes increase. 
ii. 
Prices of the goods produced in the country will be higher than those in other countries. People may buy foreign goods instead. 
Jobs in that country will be lost. 
iii. 
Businesses will be unlikely to want to expand and create more jobs in the near future. The living standards are likely to fall 
• Therefore low inflation can encourage businesses to expand and it makes it easier for a country to sell its goods and services 
abroad  
Low Unemployment  
• Unemployment exists when people who are willing and able to work cannot find a job  
• Problems resulting from unemployment: 
i. 
Unemployment people do not produce any goods or services. The total level of output in the country will be lower than it 
could be  
ii. 
The government pays unemployment benefit to those without jobs. A high level of unemployment will cost the government 
large amounts of money which can be spent on other areas 
• Therefore, low unemployment will help increase the output of a county and improve workers’ living standards  
Economic Growth  
• Economic growth is when a country’s Gross Domestic Product increases- more goods and services are produced than in the 
previous year  
• Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of output of goods and services in a country in one year  
• When a country’s GDP is falling there is no economic growth, resulting in the following problems: 
i. 
As output is falling, fewer workers are needed and unemployment will occur 
ii. 
The average standard of living of the population, the number of goods and services they can afford to buy in one year will 
decline. In effect, most people will become poorer 
iii. 
Business owners will not expand their firms as people will have less money to spend on the products they make 
• Economic growth, makes a country richer and allows living standards to rise  
 
 
 
 
 

The business cycle/ trade cycle 
▪ Growth- this is when GDP is rising, unemployment is generally falling and the country is enjoying higher living standards. Most 
businesses will do well at this time  
▪ Boom- this is caused by too much spending. Prices start to rise quickly and there will be shortages of skilled workers. Business 
costs will be rising and forms will become uncertain about the future 
▪ Recession- often caused by too little spending. This is a period when the GDP actually falls, most businesses will experience falling 
demand and profits. Workers may lose their jobs 
▪ Slump- a serious and long-drawn out recession. Unemployment will reach very high levels and prices may fall. Many business will fail 
to survive this period 
Governments will try to avoid the economy moving towards recession or a slump, but will want to reduce the chances of a boom. A boom with 
rapid inflation and higher business costs can often lead to the conditions that result in a recession.  
Balance of payments 
• Exports are goods and services sold from one country to other countries. These bring money (foreign currency) into a country. 
• Imports are goods and services bought in by one country from other countries. These must be purchased with foreign currency so 
these lead to money flowing out of a country 
• Governments will aim to achieve equality or balance between these over a period of time. 
• The difference between a country’s exports and imports is called the balance of payments  
• If the value of a country’s imports are greater than the value of its exports then it has a balance of payments deficit. 
• The problems that could result are: 
o The country could run out of foreign currencies and it may have to borrow from abroad 
o The price of the country’s currency against other currencies- the exchange rate-will be likely to fall. This is called exchange 
rate depreciation. The country’s currency will now buy less abroad than it did before depreciation. 
• Exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another  
• Exchange rate depreciation is the fall in the value of a currency compared with other currencies  
Government economic policies 
Fiscal policy 
• Fiscal policy is any change by the government in tax rates or public sector spending  
• Governments spend money in order to improve the standard of living in a country and provide necessities to citizens  
• Governments raise money through taxes on individuals and businesses 
• Direct taxes are paid directly from incomes, for example income tax or profits tax 
• Indirect taxes are added to the prices of goods and tax payers pay the tax as they purchase the goods, for example VAT 
Impact of taxes  
Income Tax 
• This is tax on people’s incomes 
• The higher a person’s income, the greater percentage of tax they will have to pay 
• Income tax is a set percentage of income 
• An increase in the rate of income tax leads to individual taxpayers would have lower disposable income 
• Disposable income is the level of income a taxpayer has after paying income tax 
• Individuals would have less money to spend and save 
• Manager may decide to produce fewer goods as sales are lower 
• Some worker could lose their jobs 

 
Profits tax (Corporation tax) 
• This is tax on the profits made by businesses-usually companies 
• An increase on the rate of corporation tax will lead to: 
i. 
Businesses having lower profits after tax, less ploughed back profit, businesses will find it difficult to expand, and new 
projects may have to be cancelled. 
ii. 
Less money to pay back to investors, fewer people starting businesses since government takes large portion of profits. 
Share prices depreciate. 
Indirect taxes 
• Added to the prices of products we all buy  
• Make goods and services more expensive 
• Governments avoid putting these taxes on essential items 
• An increase in an expenditure tax could lead to: 
i. 
Prices of good rise. Consumers buying fewer items, fall of demand. 
ii. 
Workers’ wages buy less, real incomes decline, businesses under pressure to increase wages forcing costs to rise 
Import tariffs and quotas 
• An import tariff is a tax on an imported product 
• An import quota is a physical limit to the quantity of a product that can be imported  
• Many governments try to reduce the import of products from other countries by putting special taxes on them  
• Businesses in a country can be affected by tariffs in the following ways: 
i. 
Firms will benefit if they are competing with imported goods. These will now become more expensive, leading to an increase 
in sales of the home produced products 
ii. 
Businesses will have higher costs if they have to import raw materials or components for their own factories. These will 
now be more expensive 
iii. 
Other countries may now take the same action and impose import tariffs as well, called retaliation. A business trying to 
export to these countries will have fewer sales than before 
• Another method to limit imports is to introduce an import quota 
• Quotas can be used selectively to protect certain industries from foreign competition that may be seen as unfair or damaging to jobs 
Changes in government spending 
• Governments spend tax revenue on programmes such as: education, health, law and transport 
• When governments want to boost economic growth they spend more on these programmes 
• This will create more demand in the economy, more jobs and the GDP will increase 
• If the governments want to save money, they will reduce spending  
• These cuts will have considerable impact on businesses who: 
o Produce equipment for schools, hospitals and defence 
o  Build roads, bridges and railways

increases
Individual 
taxpayers have 
less disposable 
incomes
Less money to 
spend
Businessses see

goods
Unemployment

Monetary Policies- Interest Rates  
• Monetary policy is a change in interest rates by the government or central bank 
• The following are likely to be the main effects of higher interest rates: 
o Firms with existing variable interest loans may have to pay more in interest in the banks. This will reduce profits 
o Managers thinking about borrowing money t0 expand their businesses may delay their decision. New investment in business 
activity may be reduced. Fewer new factories and offices will be built. Entrepreneurs hoping to start a new business may 
not now be able to afford to borrow the capital needed 
o If consumers have taken out loans such as mortgages, then the higher interest payments may reduce their available 
income. Demand for all goods and services could fall as there is less money available to spend 
o Businesses who make expensive consumables will notice that demand for their products will fall. Consumers will be 
unwilling to borrow money to buy these expensive items if interest rates are higher. The businesses may have to reduce 
output and make workers redundant  
o Higher interest rates in one country will encourage foreign banks and individuals to deposit their capital in that country. 
They will be able to earn higher rates of interest on their capital, by switching their money to this country’s currency they 
are increasing demand for it. This will cause the exchange rate to rise-called exchange rate appreciation. This will male 
imported goods appear cheaper and exports will be more expensive. 
 
Supply Side Policies 
• Governments aim to make the economy of their country more efficient  
• They aim to increase the competitiveness of their industries against those from foreign countries 
• This would allow home businesses to expand, produce more and employ more workers 
• Some of the policies have been implemented are: 
i. 
Privatisation- the aim is to use the profit motive to improve business efficiency  
ii. 
Improve training and education-governments plan to improve the skills of the country’s workers. This is partially important 
to those industries such as computer software which are often short of skilled staff 
iii. 
Increase competition in all industries- this may done by reducing government controls over industry or by acting against 
monopolies 
• They are called supply side policies because they are trying to improve the efficient supply of goods and services  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

How businesses might react to changes in economic policy  
Government policy change 
Possible business decision 
Problems resulting 
Increases income tax- reduces amount the 
consumers have to spend 
Lower prices on existing products to 
increase demand 
 
Produce cheaper products to allow for 
lower prices 
Less profit will be made per item 
 
Brand image will be damaged 
Increase tariffs on imports 
Focus more on the domestic market as local 
products seem cheaper 
 
Switch from buying imported materials and 
components to locally produced ones 
It might still be more profitable to export 
 
Foreign materials and components might be 
of higher quality 
Increase interest rates 
Reduce investment so future growth will be 
less 
 
Develop cheaper products that consumers 
will be better able to afford 
 
Sell assets for cash to reduce existing loans 
Other companies might still grow so market 
share could be lost 
 
Depends on the product but could 
consumers start to think that the quality and 
brand image are lower? 
 
The assets might be needed for future

Business Activity and the environment 
• Social responsibility is when a business decision benefits stakeholders, other than shareholders, for example, a 
decision to protect the environment be reducing pollution by using the latest and greenest equipment 
• Environment is our natural world including, for example, pure water, clean water and under developed 
countryside 
• Business activity aims to satisfy needs and wants but of often has an impacts on the environment. Such as: 
 Aircraft jet engine emissions damage the atmosphere 
 Pollution from factory and chimneys reduces air quality 
 Waste disposal can pollute rivers and seas 
 Transport of goods by ships and trucks burns fossil fuels such as oil which create carbon emissions and 
may be linked to global warming and climate change  
Businesses should produce and services profitably 
without worrying about the environment 
Businesses have a social responsibility towards the 
environment and this can benefit them too 
 
Protecting the environment it expensive- this may reduce 
profits 
Global warming and global pollution affect us all and 
businesses have a social responsibility to reduce these 
problems 
Firms have to increase prices to pay for environmentally 
friendly products 
Using scarce natural resources which are non-renewable 
leaves less for future generations and raises prices 
This could make firms lose competition and they could 
lose sale to businesses, perhaps in other countries who 
are not environmentally friendly 
Most scientists and environmentalists believe that 
business activity can damage the environment 
permanently 
Consumers will buy less if they have to pay higher prices 
Consumers are becoming more socially aware- they are 
increasingly demanding products from environmentally 
friendly firms and this can become a marketing advantage 
If pollution is a problem, then governments should be 
responsible to clean it up 
If businesses damage the environment, then pressure 
groups could take action to harm the firm’s reputation 
Some business owners claim there is not enough proof 
that business activity is doing permanent damage to the 
environment 
 
 
Externalities 
• Private costs of an activity are the costs paid for by business e.g. cost of land, construction, labor, maintenance 
and transportation 
• Private benefits of an activity are the gains to a business e.g. profit made from new establishment 
• Before deciding whether or not to grant planning permission the government also considers the external costs 
and external benefits i.e. the impact on the rest of society other than the business itself  

• External costs are the costs paid for by the rest of society, other than the business, as a result of business 
activity e.g. waste products will cause pollution & smoke and fumes damaging health  
• External benefits are the gains to the rest of society, other than the business, resulting from business activity e.g. 
jobs will be created & the business will pay taxes 
• The government will try to give a value of all these costs and benefits- this is called a cost-benefit analysis  
• Social costs = external costs + private costs 
• Social benefits = external benefits + private benefits  
Sustainable development 
• Sustainable development is the development which does not put at risk the living standards of future generations  
• Sustainable development means trying to achieve growth but without damaging the environment and society for 
future generations 
• Sustainable production methods are those that do minimum damage to the environment 
 
What can businesses do? 
• Use renewable energy 
• Recycle waste 
• Use fewer resources 
• Develop new environmentally friendly products and production methods  
Responding to environmental pressures and opportunities 
Pressure groups 
• A pressure group is made up of people who want to change business (or government) decisions and they take 
action such as organism consumer boycotts 
• A consumer boycott is when consumers decide not to buy products from businesses that do not act in a socially 
responsible way 
Pressure group activity is likely to change business action when: 
✓ They have popular public support and receive much media coverage 
✓ Consumer boycotts result in much reduced sales for the firm  
✓ The group is well organized and financed  
Pressure groups activity is unlikely to result in a change in business actions when: 
 What the firm is doing in unpopular but not illegal 
 The cost to the business of changing methods is more than the possible cost of poor image and lost sales 
 The firm sells to other businesses rather than to consumers-public pressure will be less effective 
Laws passed by government  
• The government can make business activities illegal  
• Manufacturers often complain that these laws make it more expensive for them to produce 

• This raises prices for consumers 
• For this reason, some governments do not pass strict laws on the environment  
Financial policies, including pollution permits 
• Pollution permits are licenses up to a certain level 
• Governments can sell a permit to a factory that produces pollution  
• If the firm produces more pollution than the permit allows, it must either but more permits from clean firms or 
pay heavy fines 
• Either way costs of business will increase 
• Firms producing less pollution can sell their permits to dirty firms  
• This encourages firms to produce goods in less polluting ways 
• Other financial penalties could be additional taxes on goods or factories that create pollution  
Being environmentally friendly can create a positive public opinion of a business and lead to possible public opinion of a 
business and lead to opportunities for sustainable growth  
Ethical Issues 
• Ethical decisions are based on a moral code. Sometimes referred to as doing the right thing \ 
• The two most extreme views are: 
o As long as a business does not deliberately break the law then any decision it makes it acceptable. 
Businesses want to make profits after all 
o Even if certain activities are not illegal, it is unethical and therefore wrong to do them despite any 
increase in profits that might occur.",987, Global warming and global pollution affect us all and  businesses have a social responsibility to reduce these problems .

Globalization 
• Globalization is the term now widely used to describe increases in worldwide trade and movement of people and 
capital between countries 
• In many ways the world us becoming one large market rather than a series of separate national markets 
• The same goods and services can be found in many countries throughout the world 
• There are several reasons for this increase in global trade and movement of products people and capital 
(globalization): 
o Increasing numbers of free trade agreements and economic unions between countries have reduced 
protection for industries 
o Consumers can purchase goods and services from other countries with few or no import controls such 
as tariffs 
o Improved and cheaper travel links and communication between all parts of the world have made it easier 
to transport products globally  
o In addition the internet allows easy price comparisons between goods from many countries  
o Online or e commerce is allowing orders to be placed from anywhere in the world  
o Many emerging ,market countries are industrializing very rapidly 
• Free trade agreements exist when countries agree to trade imports/exports with no barriers such as tariffs and 
quotas  
Globalization: potential opportunities for businesses 
Opportunity  
Impact on businesses 
Start selling exports to other countries-opening up foreign 
markets 
Increases potential sales  
Online selling allows orders for goods from abroad 
Expensive to sell abroad 
May not be popular abroad 
Open factories/operation in other countries (become 
multinational) 
Cheaper to make some goods abroad 
Quality may be compromised 
Ethical issues 
Expensive to set up operations abroad 
Import products from other countries to sell to customers 
in home country 
No trade restrictions could be profitable to import goods 
and services from other countries 
Products will need maintenance and repairs  
However, the parts and supports may not be available from 
the producer in the foreign country 
Import materials and components from other countries but 
still produce final goods in home country 
Could be cheaper to purchase these supplies due to free 
trade 
These supplies could be purchased online 
Suppliers may be unavailable  

Greater distances adds too much to transport costs 
 
Threat 
Impact on businesses 
Increasing imports into home market from foreign 
competitors 
These competitors offer cheaper products 
Sales of local business might fall  
Increased competition could stimulate local markets to 
become more efficient 
Increasing investment from multinationals to set up 
operators in home country 
Creates further competition  
Multinationals have many economies of scale  
Can afford the best employees 
Some local firms act as suppliers to multinationals 
increasing sales 
Employees may leave businesses that cannot pay the 
same or more than international competitors 
In some professions, employees will now have more 
choice about where they work 
Businesses will have to make more of an effort to keep 
their best employees 
This might encourage local businesses to use a range of 
motivational methods to keep their workers 
 
Why some governments introduce import tariffs and quotas 
• An import quota is a restriction on the quantity of a product that can be imported 
• Protectionism is when a government protects domestic firms from foreign competition using tariffs and quotas  
• Many economists believe it is better to allow local consumers to buy imported goods as cheaply as possible  
• For local business to produce and export goods and services in which they have a competitive advantage  
 
Multinational Businesses 
• Multinational businesses are those with factories, production or service operations in more than one country. 
These are sometimes known as transnational businesses  
Why do some firms become multinational? 
• To produce goods in countries with low costs 
• To extract raw material which the firm may need for production or refining  
• To produce goods nearer to the market to reduce transport costs  
• To avoid barriers to trade put up by countries to reduce the import of goods 
• To expand into different market areas to spread risks 
• To remain competitive with rival firms which may be expanding abroad  

 
Advantages of multinational businesses to the country 
✓ New investment 
✓ More exports 
✓ Fewer imports  
✓ Jobs created  
✓ More competition  
✓ Taxes paid to the government  
 
Disadvantages of multinational businesses to the country  
 Existing firms in danger 
 Profits flow out of country  
 Often only unskilled jobs created 
 Influence the government and the economy  
 Use of scarce resources",723," Globalization is the term now widely used to describe increases in worldwide trade and movement of people and capital between countries .

business,Chapter 6- Motivating Workers,"Chapter 6: Motivating Workers 
Why people work 
• Money- to pay for necessities and some luxuries 
• Security 
• Social needs (affiliation)- feeling part of a group or organization, meeting people, making friends at work 
• Esteem needs (self-importance)- feeling important 
• Job satisfaction- the enjoyment derived from feeling that you have done a good job 
Motivation 
• Motivation is the reason why employees want to work hard and work effectively for the business 
• Well motivated workers → high productivity →increased output → higher profits 
• Unhappy workers → do not work effectively → low output → lower/no profits 
Motivation Theories  
F W Taylor 
• Taylor based his ideas on the assumption that all individuals are motivated by personal gain and therefore, if they 
are paid more, they will work more effectively. He broke down their jobs into simple processes and then he 
calculated how much output they should be able to do in a day, if they produced this target output they would be 
paid more money. 
• Taylor’s ideas resulted in big productivity gains and were adopted by many businesses. 
• However there were several criticisms of his ideas: 
1. They were too simplistic- employees are motivated by many other factors and not just money 
2. You can pay an employee a lot of money but it they have no job satisfaction there will be no efficiency or 
productivity gains 
3. A practical problem arises if you cannot easily measure an employee’s output 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Abraham Maslow 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Herzberg  
• According to Fredrick Herzberg humans have two sets of needs; one is for the basic animal needs, which he called 
‘hygiene’ factors or needs, and the second is for a human to grow psychologically, which he called motivational 
needs or motivators.  
• According to Herzberg the hygiene factors must be satisfied; if they are not satisfied, they can act as motivators 
to workers.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Motivating factors-financial rewards/motivators 
• It is the responsibility of management, and often the Human Resource department to motivate the workers 
• There are three factors which can motivate employees: 
1. Financial rewards 
2. Non-financial rewards 
3. Introducing new ways to give job satisfaction 
 

Financial rewards 
Wages 
• A wage is a payment for work, usually paid weekly 
• Wages are often paid every week, sometimes in cash and sometimes into a bank account 
• When calculating wages to be paid, they can be worked out in a number of different ways: 
1. Time Rate- This is payment by the hour (payment for a period of time) 
2. Piece Rate- This is where workers are paid depending on the quantity of products made-the more they 
make, the more they are paid. 
Salaries 
• A salary is payment for work, usually paid monthly 
• Commission is payment relating to the number of sales made 
• Profit Sharing is a system whereby a proportion of the company’s profits is paid out to the employees 
• A bonus is an additional amount of payment above the basic pay as a reward for good work 
• Performance related pay is related to the effectiveness of the employee where their output can be easily 
measured 
• Share ownership is where shares in the company are given to the employees s that they become part owners in 
the company  
• An appraisal is a method of assessing the effectiveness of an employee 
Motivating factors- non financial rewards/motivators 
• Fringe benefits are non-financial rewards given to the employees 
• Non-financial rewards may include: 
1. Company vehicle (car) 
2. Discounts on the firm’s products 
3. Health care paid for 
4. Children’s education fees paid 
5. Free accommodation 
6. Share option  
7. Generous expense accounts 
8. Pension paid for by the business 
9. Free trips abroad/holidays  
• Job satisfaction is the enjoyment derived from feeling that you have done a good job 
• Job rotation involves workers swapping round and doing each specific task for a limited time and then changing 
round again 
• Job enlargement is where extra tasks of a similar level of work are added to a worker’s job description 
• Job enrichment involves looking at jobs and adding tasks that require more skill and or responsibility",693," Motivation is the reason why employees want to work hard and work effectively for the business . Well motivated workers → high productivity →increased output → higher profits . Unhappy workers → do not work effectively → low output → lower/no profits .

business,Chapter 7-Organisation and mangement,"Chapter 7: Organization and Management 
What is organizational structure?  
• Organizational structure refers to the levels of management and division of responsibilities within an 
organization. This structure is often presented in the form of an organization chart 
• Chain of command is the structure in an organization which allows instructions to be passed down from senior 
management to lower levels of management 
Advantages of an organization chart 
• The chart shows how all employees are linked 
• All employees are aware of the appropriate channels of communication 
• Employees are aware of the authoritative figures and of their position 
• It shows the links and relationship between different departments within the organization 
• Gives employees a sense of belonging  
 
• A span of control is the number of subordinates working directly under the manager 
Advantages of short chain of command 
• Communications are quicker and more accurate 
• Top managers are less remote from the lower levels in the hierarchy  
• Span of control is wider-which encourages managers to delegate and employees may obtain more job 
satisfaction from being able to make their own decisions 
Management  
• Line managers have direct responsibility over people below them in the hierarchy of an organization 
• Staff mangers are specialists who provide support, information and assistance to line mangers 
The role management 
 
• Planning- planning for the future of the organization involves setting aims or targets. These aims or targets will 
give the organization a sense of direction or purpose. There will be a common feeling in the organization of having 
something to work towards. 
• Organizing- a manger cannot do everything. Tasks must be delegated to others in the organization these people 
must have the resources to be able to do these tasks successfully. It is therefore the manager’s responsibility to 
organize people and resources effectively.  
• Coordinating- coordinating means bring together. A manager may be very good at planning and organizing but 
may have failed to bring people in the organization together. A good manger will therefore make sure all 
departments in the organization work together to achieve the plans originally set by the manger.  

• Commanding-the tasks of management is more concerned with guiding, leading and supervising. Managers also 
have to ensure that all supervisors and workers are keeping targets deadlines. Instructions and guidance must be 
provided by mangers and it is also their responsibility to make sure that the tasks are carried out by people 
below them in the organization 
• Controlling- This is the never ending task of management. Managers must try to measure and evaluate the work 
of all individuals and groups to make sure that they are on target. There is little point in planning and organizing if 
managers fail to check that the original aims are being met. If certain groups are failing to meet their targets, 
then managers may have to take some corrective action. 
 
Without clear and effective managers, a business will lack: 
• A sense of control and direction 
• Coordination between departments, leading to wastage of effort 
• Control of employees 
• Organization of resources, leading to low output and sales  
Delegation 
• Delegation means giving a subordinate the authority to perform particular tasks.  
 
Advantages to managers 
• Managers are less likely to make mistakes if some tasks are being performed by their subordinates 
• Managers can measure the success of their staff more easily.  
Advantages to subordinates 
• The work becomes more interesting and rewarding 
• Employees feel more important and believes that trust is being put in them to perform a job well 
• Delegation helps to train workers and they can then make progress in the organization. It gives them career 
opportunities  
Why might a manger not delegate? 
• Some managers are reluctant to delegate as they may be afraid that the subordinates may fail to do the job and 
managers want to control everything themselves. There is a risk that the subordinate might do a better job than 
the manger which could make the manager feel insecure 

• Delegation must mean a reduction in direct control by supervisors and managers once tasks are done by 
workers, and increasing trust of the workers by supervisors and managers.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effective managers 
 
 
 
 
 
Why is it important to have good managers? 
• Motivate employees 
• Guidance 
• Inspiration 
• Keep costs under control 
• Increase profitability 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Delegation 
• 
Makes work more interesting 
•

1.5 Impact of Emerging Technologies 
Artificial intelligence biometrics 
• Artificial Intelligence overcomes the problems associated with biometrics by dynamically profiling. The system learns from the 
different alignments and is therefore able to match fingerprints to those stored on a database. New systems use AI to learn 
from scanning a number of faces and can pick out soft biometric features. This means the system can still recognise faces and 
cross-reference these attributes with corresponding images stored on the database 
Vision enhancement 
• Low Vision Enhancement Systems (LVES) uses video technology through a headset connected to a computer. The system allows 
images to be projected inside the headset in front of the eyes. This effectively brings the objects closer for examination by the 
user of the system 
• Night Vision Enhancement (NVE) amplifies infrared light and visible light so that an image can still be seen in the darkness. 
Robotics 
• Used in car factories to weld car bodies, spray body panels and fit items such as widescreens 
• Drones are unmanned flying devices that are used by military for surveillance, and by civilians as means of surveying data for 
GPS systems, monitoring weather patterns and search or rescue missions in hazardous conditions. 
• They are also used in surgical procedures to allow precision, flexibility and control. Surgeons use robotic, mechanical arms with 
joints which work like that of a human and are equipped with cameras. 
Quantum Cryptography  
• The science of making information unintelligible to a hacker i.e. encrypting 
Computer Assisted Translation 
• CAT is a type of language translator that uses specific software to help in the translation process. In particular CAT uses two 
tools: terminology databases and translation memories  
 

3D and holograph imaging 
• The technology involves the use of: a source of laser light, interference of light, light diffraction and light intensity recording 
• As a holographic image is rotated, it appears to move in the same way as the original object thus depicting three dimensions 
• Holograms are used in: engineering design, architecture, simulations, medical imaging, cinema, gaming, advertising, 
holographic televisions, holographic computer memories and optical computers 
Virtual Reality 
• Virtual reality is an artificial environment created by software. The use makes use of data goggles, sensor suits, data gloves or 
helmets to get a feeling of reality. The technology is used in training, education or in games. 
• Virtual reality is also used in: military applications, education, healthcare, entertainment, fashion, heritage, business, real estate, 
engineering, sport and media.",1548," Hardware is a general term for the physical components of a computer system . Software is divided into two categories: system software and application software .

offered in each question 
Poor handwriting may cause 
reading errors 
The position of the marks is 
compared to a template 
stored in memory 
Used for converting printed 
documents to an editable 
electronic format 
OMR reads the position of 
marks, so it is ideal for 
multiple choice exam papers 
OCR requires a complex 
recognition system 
Requires complex and 
expensive forms to be 
completed but the 
recognition system is 
simpler than OCR 
Fewer how to full in 
instructions are needed 
Requires more how to fill in 
instructions, it is easier to 
complete OMR than OCR 
OCR is more accurate 
however there are still 
problems recognising all 
types of handwriting leading 
to inaccuracies  
OMR is essentially a more 
accurate method for reading 
OCR

LCD and LED monitors 
• LCD monitors don’t emit any light so some form of back 
lit technology needs to be used. Modern LCD monitors 
are backlit using LED (light emitting diode) technology. 
Before the use of LEDs, LCD monitors used CCFL (cold 
cathode fluorescent lamp) as a backlighting method 
Comparison of LED and CCFL 
• LEDs reach their maximum brightness almost 
immediately- there is no need to warm up to reach full 
efficiency 
• LEDs give a whiter light, which sharpens the image and 
makes the colours appear more vivid, CCFL had a 
slightly yellowish tint 
• LEDs produce a brighter light which improves colour 
definition 
• Monitors using LED technology are much thinner than 
monitors using CCFL technology 
• LEDs last almost indefinitely, making the technology 
more reliable and consistent  
• LEDs consume very little power, which means they 
produce less hear as well as using less energy

ict,4. Networks and the effects of using them,"Networks and the effects of using them  
• A computer network is developed by linking computer systems together so that they can 
communicate with each other, share computing power and storage facility. It is inclusive of all 
the individual computer systems, connections and hardware which enables communication  
Advantages of networking 
i. 
Computers can communicate with each other easily 
ii. 
Computers can share data and files  
iii. 
Computing power and/or storage facility can be shared 
iv. 
Hardware such as printers are required 
v. 
There is control over which programs a user has access to  
Disadvantages  
i. 
A virus can spread more easily  
ii. 
Greater need for security  
iii. 
If the server fails, all work stations will be affected 
iv. 
Installation costs are high  
v. 
Damage to cables can isolate computers from the network  
Network devices 
Modems 
• Stands for modulator demodulator  
• Converts a computers’ digital signal to analogue signal for transmission over an existing 
telephone line  
• It also converts analogue signals to digital signals to enable the computer to process the data 
• Modems essentially used to allow computers to connect to networks over long distances using 
telephone lines  
Hubs 
• Hubs are hardware devices that can have several devices or computers connected to them  
• They are often used to connect a number of devices to form a LAN 
• Its main task is to distribute a received data packet to every computer on the network  
• It is not a very secure or efficient method of data distribution  
Switches  
• They connect a number of devices or computers together to form a LAN 
• The switch checks the data and sends the data to the appropriate computers only 
• This makes a more secure way of distributing data 
• Each device or computer has a MAC address which uniquely identifies it 
• Data packets sent to switches will have a MAC address identifying each device that should 
receive the data 
 
 

Bridge  
• Bridges are devices that connect one LAN to another LAN that uses the same protocol 
(communication rules) 
• They are often used to connect different parts of a LAN so that they function as a single LAN 
• They are used with interconnected LANs to avoid unnecessary traffic 
Router  
• Routers enable data packets to be routed between different networks (e.g. between a LAN and a 
WAN) 
• A router will typically have an internet cable plugged into it and several cables connecting to 
computers and other devices in the LAN 
• Broadband router sit behind a firewall. The firewall protects the computers on a network 
• The routers’ main function is to transmit internet and transmission protocols between two 
networks and also allow private networks to be connected together  
• Routers send data packets sent to it from any computer on any of the networks connected to it  
• Since every computer on the same network has the same part of an IP address, the router is able 
to send the data packet to the appropriate switch and it will then be delivered using the MAC 
address 
• If the MAC address doesn’t match any device on the network, it passes on to another switch on 
the same network until the appropriate device is found  
Data packets  
Packets of data usually contain the following information: 
i. 
Some form of header to identify the data packets 
ii. 
The sender’s IP address 
iii. 
The receiver’s IP address 
iv. 
How many data packets make up the whole message  
v. 
The identity number of each packet  
 
• This information allows the router to route a packet across a network to its correct destination and 
allows the data to be reassembled in its correct order according to identity number at the receiving 
station  
• When a router receives a packet of data, it checks the destination IP address against a stored 
routing table  
• The routing table stores the MAC address of the device, the assigned IP address and the lease time 
the IP address is assigned for  
• The bits forming the destination IP address in the data packet are used to point to the correct route 
• The packet is sent to a number of routers until it reaches its final destination 
Gateway 
• A network point or node that acts as an entrance to another network 
Network interface card (NIC) 
• Needed to allow a device to connect to a network 

• It is usually part of the device hardware and frequently contains the MAC address generated at 
the manufacturing stage  
Network cables  
• Network cables are used because they have faster data transfer rates and can be more secure 
than wireless networks as compared to Wi-Fi 
• Made from copper or fibre optic cables 
• The fibre optic cables offer higher data transfer rates and better security  
IP (Internet Protocol) and MAC (Media Access Control) addresses  
• Each device on the internet is given a unique address called an Internet Protocol Address, it is 
written in the form of a 32 bit number  
• A MAC address is a unique number that identifies a device connected to the internet  
• An IP address gives the location of a device on the internet whereas a MAC address identifies 
the device connected to the internet  
Wi-Fi 
• Refers to nay system where it is possible to connect to a network through wireless 
communication  
• A wireless transmitter (WAP) receives information from a network via its connection  
• This transmitter converts the received information into radio waves and then transmits them  
• A device receives the radio waves and via an installed wireless adaptor which allows it to 
download the information from the data source 
• This works in reverse when the device wishes to transmit data over a network 
• Wi-Fi is best suited to operating on full scale networks since it offers faster data transfer rates, 
better range and better security than Bluetooth  
• In essence, Wi-Fi relies on some form of access point which uses radio frequency technology to 
enable the devices to send and receive signals 
Bluetooth  
• Bluetooth sends and receives waves in a band of 79 different frequencies (channels) 
• Devices using Bluetooth automatically detect and connect to each other but they don’t interfere 
with other devices since each communicating pair uses a different channel  
• When a device wants to communicate, it picks one of the 79 channels at random  
• If the channel is being used, it randomly picks another channel  
• This is called spread spectrum frequency hopping  
• To further minimise the risks of interference with other devices, the communication pairs 
constantly change frequency 
• Bluetooth is useful when: 
i. 
When transferring data between two or more devices that are very close together  
ii. 
When the speed of data transmission is not critical  
iii. 
For low band width applications  
• Bluetooth creates a secure WPAN (wireless personal area network) based on key encryption 
 
 

How to set up and configure a small network  
• Setting up an IP account if internet access is required 
• Setting up the system (buying the appropriate hardware correctly configured) to allow for 
wireless connectivity  
• Configure all hardware and software so that they work together  
• If internet is requires, ensuring that a high speed broadband exists  
• Putting all the common software onto a server and also making sure that a network licence has 
been acquired so that all network users can make use of the software 
• Setting up privileges so that each user can only access their own area or common shared area 
• Setting up a network manager level of privilege so that they can monitor network usage  
Internet  
• The internet is a worldwide collection of networks that allows users to: 
i. 
Send and receive emails 
ii. 
Chat online  
iii. 
Transfer files from computer to computer  
iv. 
Browse the world wide web  
 
• The world wide web is only a part of the internet by which users can access by way of a web 
browser  
• It consists of a massive collection of webpages and has been based on the http (hypertext 
transfer protocol)  
Intranet  
• Intranet is a computer based network based on internet technology but is designed to meet the 
internal needs for sharing information within a single organisation or company  
• Intranets reside behind a firewall and are only accessible to: internal members of an 
organisation, people given various levels of access who are external to the company  
• Intranets are safer than internet since there is a less chance of external hacking or viruses 
•  It is possible to prevent external links to certain websites 
• Companies can ensure that the information available is specific to their needs 
• It is  easier to send out sensitive information knowing that it will remain within the organisation 
• Intranets offer a better bandwidth than the internet thus there are fewer connection limits than 
with the internet  
• It is possible to create extranets that allow intranets to be extended outside the organisation  
What are the differences between internet and intranet?  
• The term intranet stems from internal restricted access network 
• The term internet stems from international network 
• A intranet is used to give local information relevant to the company or organisation whereas 
internet covers topics of global interest  
• It is possible to block certain websites using the intranet while this is also possible with internet, 
it is more difficult 

• An intranet requires password and a user ID entry and can only be accessed from agreed 
points/computer; the internet can be accessed from anywhere provided the user has an ISP 
account  
• An intranet is behind a firewall, which gives some protection against hackers, viruses, and so on; 
this is more difficult with internet access since its open on an international scale  
• The internet can be public access, whereas intranets tend to be private access 
Local Area Networks (LANs) 
• These systems are usually restricted to one building and do not extend over a large 
geographical area 
• A typical LAN will consist of a number of computers and devices that are connected to hubs or 
switches 
• One of the hubs or switches will usually be connected to a router and a modem to allow the LAN 
to connect to the internet, doing so it becomes part of a WAN 
Advantages  
i. 
The sharing of resources 
ii. 
 Ease of communication between users 
iii. 
A network administrator to control and monitor all aspects of the network 
Disadvantages  
i. 
Easier spread of viruses throughout the whole network  
ii. 
Printer ques developing, which can be frustrating  
iii. 
Slower access to external networks, such as internet  
iv. 
Increased security risk when compared to individual computers 
v. 
If the main server breaks down, in most case the network will no longer function  
Wide Area Networks (WANs) 
• WANs are used when computers or networks are located at a long distance from each other 
geographically 
• Several LANs joined together form a WAN 
• The most common examples of WAN include the internet and the network of ATMs used by banks 
• Because of the long distances between devices, WANs usually make use of some public 
communications networks 
• But they can use dedicated or leased communication lines which can be less expensive and also 
more secure 
• A typical WAN system consists of end systems and intermediate systems 
Wireless LANs (WLANs) 
• They are similar to LANs but there are no wires or cables  
• They provide wireless network communication over fairly short distances using radio infrared 
signals 
• Access points or wireless nodes are connected into the wired network at fixed locations 
• The Aps receives and transmits data between the WLAN and the wired network  
• Users access the WLAN through wireless LAN adapters that are built into the devices or plug in 
model  

Advantages 
i. 
All computers can access the same resources from anywhere within the access point  
ii. 
As there is no cabling there is greater safety improvement and increased flexibility  
iii. 
Adding new computers and devices is very easy and the costs are reduced since extra cabling 
isn’t needed 
Disadvantages  
i. 
Security ~ anyone with a WLAN enabled laptop can access the network

Accessing the internet using a laptop 
Advantages  
i. 
Laptops are more portable as compared to desktops but heavier and less portable than mobile 
phones 
ii. 
Touchpads on laptops are easier to use than touch screens on mobile phones 
iii. 
The keyboards on laptops are easier to use than those on mobile phones but not as compact as 
those on a desktop computer 
Disadvantages  
i. 
Although the screen is usually larger than mobile phones and tablets it is not as large as those 
on a desktop computer 
ii. 
Laptops require expensive dongles to access phone networks 
iii. 
Processors used in laptops are not as powerful as those in desktops, so access speed is not as 
quick 
Accessing the internet using a desktop computer  
Advantages  
i.

Network issues and communication  
Should the internet be policed? 
Reasons in favour of control 
• It would help to prevent illegal material being posted on websites 
• People find it much easier to discover dangerous information, although available in books, it is 
easier with a search engine 
• It would help to prevent children and other vulnerable groups from being subjected to 
undesirable websites 
• It would help to stop incorrect information being published on websites 
Arguments against control 
• Material published on websites are already available from other sources 
• It would be expensive to police all websites and users would have to pay for access 
• It would be difficult to enforce rules and regulations on a global scale 
• It can be argued that policing would go against the freedom of information 
• Laws already exist to deal with those who deal with immoral content  
Inappropriate sites and the accuracy of information 
Reliability of information 
• Information on the internet is more likely to be more up to date than books 
• It is much easier to attain information from websites  
• Information could be incorrect, biased or inaccurate 
Undesirability of certain websites 
• There is always a risk of finding undesirable websites 
• There is a risk of connecting to in genuine websites  
• Security risks  
Security issues 
Passwords 
Protection of passwords: 
1. Run anti spyware software to ensure that your passwords aren’t being relayed back to whoever 
put spyware on your computer 
2. Change passwords on a regular in case they have been possessed illegally or accidently 

3. Passwords should not be very easy to break or guess 
Characteristics of a strong password: 
1. At least one capital letter 
2. At least one numerical value 
3. At least one keyboard character  
Authentication techniques 
• User IDs and passwords 
• Digital certificates 
• Biometrics 
• Magnetic stripes/ID cards/passwords 
Methods of avoiding viruses 
Anti-virus software 
• They check the software of files before they are run or loaded onto a computer 
• Antivirus software compares a possible virus against a database of known viruses 
• They carry out heuristic checking (checking for behaviour that detects a possible virus) 
• Any possible programs that are infected are then put into quarantine that allows the virus to be 
deleted o allows users to make the decision of deletion  
• Anti-virus software need to be kept up to date as new viruses are constantly being discovered 
• Full system checks should be carried out at least once a week  
Avoiding viruses when accessing the internet  
• Avoid unknown or suspicious looking websites 
• Look for security indicators such as ‘https’ or the padlock symbol 
• Look out for odd behaviours on the URL 
• Copy and paste links into the URL as opposed to clicking on direct links 
• Don’t open emails from unknown source 
• Apply common sense 
Viruses from hardware devices 
• it is possible to pick up viruses from any device that is plugged into your computer 
• even with the precaution of scanning, it is unsafe to plug in a device from unknown sources  
Data protection acts 
• There are general guidelines about how to stop data being obtained unlawfully: 
i. 
Don’t leave personal information lying around on a desk when unattended 
ii. 
Lock filing cabinets at the end of the day when the room in unoccupied  
iii. 
Do not leave data on a computer monitor is if it unattended 
iv. 
Use passwords and user IDs 
v. 
Make sure that information being sent via fax or email is not sensitive  
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Network communication 
Fax- fax is short for the word facsimile 
• Documents are scanned electronically and converted to bit map image ( a bit is a binary digit 
either 1 or 0) 
• This is then transmitted as a series of electrical signals through the telephone network 
• The receiving fax machine converts this image and prints it out on paper 
• More modern ways of faxing occurs electronically which makes use of computer technology and 
the internet  
E-mail 
• This is an electronic method of sending text and attachments from one computer to another over 
a network 
Advantages 
i. 
It is fast to send and receive replies using the email 
ii. 
Low costs since stamps, paper and envelopers are not needed 
iii.

iv. 
You cannot send or sign legal documents over email 
 
Faxes  
Emails 
More likely to be intercepted as it needs to be 
printed 
More secure than faxed 
Signatures on faxes are accepted legally 
No need to print the document 
The quality of documents can be quite poor 
The document is usually a better quality 
If telephone network is busy-there can be a delay 
Can be modified, copied and pasted to other 
documents 
Can be slow if several documents are to be 
scanned to be transmitted 
Much easier to send to multiple recipients at the 
same time 
People are more likely to have access to email 
accounts than a fax machine

• Audio conferencing refers to meetings held between people using audio or sound equipment 
• An audio conferencing can be done over a telephone network and that is referred to as phone 
conferencing 
The following are steps carried out when having a phone conferencing: 
1) The organiser of the conference is given two PINs by the phone company, one PIN is the 
personal PIN given to the organiser and the second PIN is given to the participants 
2) The organiser contacts all participants and informs them of their PIN and the time of conference 
3) Just before the beginning of the conference the organiser dials the conference phone number; 
once connected the personal PIN number is keyed in 
4) The participants call the same conference number and then when connected, they key in their 
PIN numbers. Then the conference will begin  
Web Conferencing  
• Referred to as webinar 
• Uses internet to permit conferencing to take place  
• Multiple computers are used connected to the internet  
• Carried out in real time 
• Allows business meetings, presentations, and online training/education to take place 
• Only requirement is high speed, stable internet 
• Web conferencing is carried out on an app or website 

• The organiser can decide who can speak with a control panel on their computer 
• If a delegate wishes to say something- a flag is raised next to their name 
• Delegates can posy comments

The effects of ICT on employment 
1. Manufacturing- robots have replaced human workers in many areas of manufacturing 
2. Shop work- online shopping has reduced the need for high-street shops, leading to loss of staff 
3. Banking- introduction of ATMs and online banking has led to the closure of many high street 
branches 
4. Office work- spreadsheets, word processors and databases have taken over many of the tasks 
once carried out by office staff 
The introduction of ICT systems whether to improve efficiency, reduce costs or improve safety- has led 
to redundancies in many areas of industry and commerce.  
Advantages of robots over humans

ii. 
More consistent results 
iii. 
They work non-stop without any breaks, holidays or time for shift handovers 
iv. 
They don’t get bored with repetitive tasks 
v. 
They don’t go on strike 
vi. 
They work out cheaper in the long term thane employing people  
Disadvantages of robots over humans 
i. 
Robots are initially expensive to set up and purchase 
ii. 
They have to be re-programmed for tasks often, which can be expensive and time consuming  
iii. 
If an error occurs in the robot’s programming, or if it develops a mechanical problem, a number 
of production errors will occur until the fault has been identified  
Positive effects

The Effects of ICT on working patterns 
Working Pattern 
Description 
Part time working 
Staff work between 1 and 30 hours a week; or someone who works fewer 
hours per week than full-time staff-this can either mean fewer hours per day 
or fewer days per week 
Job Sharing 
A full time job is shared between two part time workers, both workers are 
doing the same job; one picks up where the other one left of 

Flexible working 
(flexi-time) 
Any working schedule outside the traditional working pattern; employees 
can vary when they want to work or even where they want to work. Flexi-time 
is the ability to choose the start and the finish of the times, but they must 
complete a full day’s work. This requires agreement with the employer to 
ensure the office is manned at all times 
Compressed hours 
In compressed hours, an employee works their full hours for the week but 
works for fewer days 
 
Microprocessor controlled devices in the home  
• Labour saving devices- automatic washing machines, microwave ovens, dishwashers

• Information includes company logo, promoted product or service and contact details 
• Makes it easier to target a specific audience 
Data Handling Applications 
Surveys  
All data handling starts with data collection: 
• Data capture forms can be used for many applications 
• Decide what needs to be collected and then what questions should be used to collect it  

• Paper and electronic 
Rules for creating forms: 
• Make them look official  
• Spaces should be thought about giving enough space for answers 
• Restrict the amount of possible answers, do not use open questions 
• If open questions are used there us limited amount of space available  
 
• Asking for ‘name’ needs to be carefully thought about 
What names do you want? 
• Are you asking for sensitive information? 
People may not feel comfortable being truthful  
• Date of birth  
What format do you want it in? 
• Give instructions about how to answer questions 
• How will the data be collected? 
Paper surveys are scanned using OMR or OCR 
Advantages

An address book on a computer or mobile phone might have a contact’s home address, phone number, 
email address, and personal information like the date of birth etc. 
 
Clubs and Society Records 
• Need to keep a record on member usually in a database  
• Usually payment details, contact details and interests  
• It makes it easy to match people with interests and send information about what they are 
interested in  
• This can be done using mail merging  
• Easy to check memberships and send out reminders 

• It is important to follow the data protection act 
School Reports 
• Database applications such as SIMS store large amounts of data which can be used to create 
annual and termly school reports 
• Things able to be gathered from here are: 
i. 
Data of each individual student- test/ exam results 
ii. 
Student progress- if the target grades are being met or not 
iii. 
Number of absences- can create a percentage of amount of days attended school  
iv. 
Teacher’s comments 
Measurement Applications  
• Sensors are used to send data to a computer where data is processed 
• The computer simply reviews the data from the sensors (by comparing it to data stored in 
memory) and updates its files and/or gives a warning signal if the values are outside given 
parameters 
• No changed to the processes are made  
• Examples: scientific experiments and weather stations 
Analogue and Digital Data 
• Digital data: discrete, fixed value (used by computers) 
• Analogue data: continuous value that varies smoothly  
• Sensors measure physical and analogue quantities 
• Analogue data from sensors needs to be converted into digital data using and analogue to 
digital converter (ADC) so that the computer understands and processes the data from the 
sensors 
• If the computer sends signals to motors, valves, etc. then this data needs to be converted to 
analogue using a digital to analogue converter (DAC) so that the computer can effectively 
control these devices 
Analogue to Digital Convertor (ADC) 
• Used when you want to attach an analogue input device to a digital device 
• This is so the analogue data can be understood/processed by the computer since computer can 
only comprehend digital data 
Digital to Analogue Convertor (DAC) 
• Used when you want to attach an analogue output to a digital device 
Pollution Monitoring 
Example: monitoring oxygen levels in a river 
• Sensors read data from the river (oxygen levels and acidity levels using a pH sensor) 
• The data from the sensors is converted into digital data using an ADC 
• The computer stores the received data 
• The oxygen levels and acidity levels are compared to the historical data stored in memory and 
they are also compared to alarm levels stored in memory 

• One of two things will now happen: either the data is transferred to a CD/DVD or to a memory 
stick and taken away for analysis later or the computer is connected to a mobile phone network 
and transmits the data back automatically to the monitoring system  
Intensive Care Units in Hospitals 
• Sensors read key vital signs (such as pulse/heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiration 
etc.) 
• The data from the sensors is converted to digital data using an ADC 
• The data is stored in the computer memory 
• The results are output on a screen in the form of graphs, and or digital read outs 
• An alarm is activated if any of the data is outside acceptable parameters 
• The system continues to monitor the patient until the computer is turned off ‘ 
Advantages of using Computers in Measurement 
i. 
The computer will not forget to take readings 
ii. 
 The computer’s response time is much faster 
iii. 
Professionals can get on with other tasks while the monitoring is done automatically 
iv. 
Computer is able to monitor 24/7 
v. 
The recordings tend to be more accurate  
vi. 
Readings can be taken more frequently 
vii. 
It could be potentially safer if the conditions being monitored are hazardous  
Disadvantages 
• Expensive to purchase and set up 
• If performed for educational purposes, reduced practical hands-on experience and learning  
• Will not function in a power cut if no backup power is present (expensive to have reliable backup 
power) 
Microprocessors in Control Applications 
• Sensors are used to send data to a computer where the data is processed 
• The computer reviews the data from the sensors (by comparing it to data stored in memory) 
• If the values are outside the given parameters/ pre-set value it acts to try and get the values 
within acceptable ranges 
• It does this by sending signals to devices controlling the process 
Turtle Graphics 
• Based on a computer language called LOGO and is now usually known as turtle graphics 
• It is the control of the movement of a turtle on a computer screen by several key instructions 
which can be typed in  
• The use of ‘repeat’ instructions make a piece of code more efficient  
Automatic Washing Machines 
• Have a microprocessor in them which contains the software which controls the washing machine  
Inputs 
▪ Pressure sensor on the door to detect if open or closed 

▪ Sensor to detect if the required level of water is inside 
▪ Temperature sensor to check temperature  
Outcome 
▪ Clothes have been washed 
Outputs 
▪ Heater  
▪ Motor to spin drum 
▪ Lights on machine to show user stage the cycle is at 
▪ Actuators to turn the inlet valves to allow hot and cold water into the machine 
▪ Actuator to turn the outlet valve on to let the water out of the machine when the wash is complete 
▪ An actuator to control the pimp  
Processing  
▪ Software to make decisions which will allow the clothes to be washed  
Time taken before next inputs 
▪ Timer as part of the software 
▪ Timer as a part of the software 
▪ Time different cycles (when to add soap/conditioner etc.) 
▪ Time delay in measuring temperature 
▪ Needs to be time for changes to have effect  
Unmanageable situations  
▪ Door may not be shut 
▪ Needs to draw user’s attention  
▪ Usually a buzzer and light  
Central Heating System  
Inputs 
▪ Inputs from the user: room temperature required, time system turns on/off 
▪ Inputs from the system: actual room temperature, clock giving time  
Outcome  
▪ Heating or cooling room during the required times  
Outputs 
▪ Boiler  
▪ Air conditioner 
Processing  
▪ Check time against the one input and switches on when that time is reached 
▪ Same done to check when to turn off 
▪ When on microprocessor reads temperature from sensor and compares it with desired 
temperature 

▪ If too low, it will heat up by turning the boiler on and if it’s not too high it will turn the air 
conditioner on 
▪ These will stay on until desired temperature is reached 
Automatic Cookers 
▪ Have temperature sensors and timers with manual controls to set start and end times, and 
temperature for cooking  
▪ Works similar to Central Heating System  
Burglar Alarm  
Burglar alarms detect any intrusion  
• Sensors such as motion sensors, door and window sensors, magnetic sensors, multi-functional 
sensors measure the physical quantity and inputs the value to a microprocessor 
• The microprocessor compares the input values with the pre-set values, if changes are detected, 
the microprocessor sends signals to the actuator 
• The actuator activate the sirens or give a phone call or messages the input mobile number  
Glasshouse  
• Temperature controlled the same as central heating system  
• Humidity must also be controlled: 
▪ Humidity sensor tells computer how humid it is 
▪ Computer then decides to turn the water supply to sprayers 
• Windows also operated by the computer: 
▪ Need to find the balance of how often to have windows open  
• Blinds that can be computer controlled: 
▪ Light sensor measure light intensity  
▪ When sun is strong the computer actuates electric motors which close blinds 
• Control in glasshouses is more likely to be used in commercial areas or large glasshouses not 
in gardens  
Modelling Applications 
• A mathematical computer model is created to manipulate variables and see real time changes in 
terms of figures 
• Used to find how mechanisms control a system  
Advantages 
i. 
Cheaper than building physical system to test

Applications in Manufacturing Industries 
Robotics 
• Robots are used in many areas of manufacturing, from heavy work right through to delicate 
operations 
• Control of robots is either through embedded microprocessors or linked to a computer system 
• Programing of the robot to do a task is generally done in two ways: 
i. 
The robot is programmed with a sequence of instructions which allow it to carry out a 
series of tasks  
ii. 
Alternatively, a human operator manually carries out a series of tasks and how each 
task is done is relayed back to the robot (embedded processor) or controlling 
computer. The sequence of instructions is remembered so that the robot can 
automatically carry out each task identically at each time  
• Robots are often equipped with sensors so they can gather important information about their 
surroundings  
• Sensors also prevent them from doing ‘stupid things’ such as stopping a robot from spraying a 
car is no car is present, or stopping the spraying operation if the supply of paint has run out 
• Robots are very good at repetitive tasks 
• However, if there are many different task, then it is often better to us human operators 
Advantages 
i. 
Robots can work in environments harmful to human health 
ii. 
They can work 24/7 
iii. 
They are less expensive in the long term, however purchases expenses are initially high 
iv. 
Productivity is higher  
v. 
There is greater consistency- every item coming off a production line is identical  
vi. 
They can do monotonous tasks, leaving humans do more skilled work 
Disadvantages 
i. 
Robots find it difficult to do unusual tasks 
ii. 
They replace skilled labour, leading to unemployment 
iii. 
Risk of de-skilling of the work force 
iv. 
Robots are independent skill bases, they can be easily shifted across the globe, causing 
unemployment  
School Management Systems 
Learner registration and attendance  
• ID cards with magnetic tapes: The students will have to swipe their ID cards, which contain the 
student’s name, school’s name, date of birth and the registration ID, when they enter and leave 
the school, this way time is saved and the attendance is more accurate 
• Biometrics: Every student’s fingerprint is stored on a database along with their personal 
information, the students must put their finger on a fingerprint scanner to enter and leave the 
school premises  
 
 

Advantages  
i. 
Fingerprints are unique, so another student can’t give their attendance for someone else 
ii. 
ID cards can be lost, whilst fingerprints cannot

Learner performance  
• Spreadsheets can be used to record students’ performances. It is easier to compare their 
performances as an individual students throughout the academic year 
Organising examinations  
• Makes sure that the students are enrolled for the right exams 
• Prints the exams timetables 
• Allots examination rooms and the invigilator  
• Gathers the results and puts them into a student database 
Creating timetables and managing substitution  
• Considers the students’ choices, availability of teachers and rooms, subject clashes and the 
number of hours needed for each subject to produce accurate timetables that can easily be made 
changes to and cover with teacher to be substituted

available  
Booking Systems 
Booking systems are used for transport, cinemas and theatres 
Theatre booking system 
• Customer clicks on the performance they wish to see 

• They enter date and time of performance and required number of seats 
• A seating display at theatre is then shown on screen and user clicks where they want to sit 
• Database searched to check for the availability of selected seats. If seating plan shown on 
screen, this isn’t required 
• If seats are available, seat numbers are shown together with total price 
• If customer is happy with this, they select ‘confirm’ 
the seats are now temporarily set as ‘no longer available; 
• The customer then enters the personal details or indicates that they are a returning customer 
• They select a payment method and make payment 
• The theatre seats are then booked in the customer’s name  
• The final details are shown on the screen, together with a reference number 
• An email is sent to the customer which they print out as their proof of purchase. In some cases, 
this also acts as their printed ticket, when they go to the theatre (e-ticket) 
• The database is updated with the transaction  
Advantages 
i. 
No double booking as minimal delay 
ii.

Types of Online Processing  
Real time (transaction) Processing  
• It is used in things like booking seats in a flight or theatre  
• Required when a query is sent and the response should be immediate to prevent any problems  
Real time Process Control 
• System usually involves sensors and feedbacks loops continually monitored and input is 
processed quickly enough to influence the input source  
Banking Applications 
• Online banking systems rely on the ability to update files immediately, thus preventing double 
booking which could happen if the system response is slow  
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) 
• Allows money transfer instructions to be sent directly to a bank’s computer system 

• No actual money is transferred, the whole system relies on electronic transfer of money between 
accounts  
• When an EFT transfer instruction is received, the computer automatically transfers the specified 
amount from one account to another 
ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) 
Places where customers can get cash (or carry out certain other banking activities) using their credit or 
debit card 
Sequence at ATM 
What goes on behind the scenes 
1. Customers puts card into ATM 
2. PIN is entered using the keypad 
3. A number of options are displayed the 
customer selects the cash options and 
several cash options are shown 
4. The customer accepts the options or types 
in a different amount 
5. The customer is asked if they want a receipt 
6. The card is returned  
7. Money is dispensed 
➢ Contact is made with bank’s computer 
➢ PIN is checked to see if it is correct  
➢ Card is checked to see if it valid 
➢ The customer’s account is assessed to see 
if they have sufficient funds 
➢ It is checked to see if they are withdrawing 
more than their daily limit 
➢ Transaction is processes 
➢ Customer’s account is update 
 
• Although ATMs are very convenient for customer, they do have a few disadvantages though: 
i. 
Often in places where theft can take place unnoticed 
ii. 
Fake ATMs can be set up to gather information about the card and retain the card 
iii. 
Some banks charge customers for the use of ATMs 
iv. 
Shoulder surfing  
Clearing cheques  
• The recipient deposits the check to their bank where the cheque is sent to a clearing centre 
• a sorter/reader reads the sort code (unique 6 figure), cheque number, the account number and 
amount on the cheque 
• Depending on the sort code, the cheque is sent to its respective exchange centre 
• The data from the cheque is encrypted and stored in a file called IBDE (interbank exchange) 
along with a digital signature to certify the cheque’s authenticity  
• From the exchange centre, the cheque is passed to the respective bank 
• The bank’s system verifies the digital signature and then has its sorter/reader sort the cheques in 
order of the cheque’s pertaining branch 
• The payee’s account is checked to see if adequate funds are present 
• The cheque’s details have to be correct, and if it is correct the money is transferred from the 
payee’s account to the recipient’s account 
• If the details on the check are incorrect/fraudulent then the check is bounced 
Phone Banking 
1. The customer calls the bank using a telephone 
2. The customer keys in or types in their account number 

3. The customer is required to enter a 4 digit PIN 
4. The customer will hear various options 
5. The customer will chose one of the options and the transaction will be carried out as required 
Internet Banking 
Using a username and password, logging on to a bank site from your computer or smart phone to may 
payments, transfer money, view statements, apply for loans etc.

costs. They can also be made with changes easily, whereas it wasn’t the same with 
traditional methods 
Computers in Libraries 
• Many library systems are computer controlled 
• They usually involve the use of barcodes on the books being borrowed and on the borrower’s 
library card 
• The following describes a computerized library system based on barcodes 
• There are two files: 
i. 
Book file, containing information about the book such as the barcodes, book title, 
name of author etc. 
ii. 
Borrower’s file, containing information about the individual who borrowed the book, 
such as the borrower’s number, borrower’s name etc. 
• When the borrower’s takes out the book, the book’s barcode is scanned and the book details are 
found in the book files 
• The borrower’s library card barcode is then scanned, the book file is linked to the borrower’s file  
• Both files are updated to indicate which book has been borrowed and when it is due 
• When the book has been returned, the barcode of the book is scanned again and the records are 
updated to indicate that the book has been returned and is available for others 
• On a daily basis, the borrower’s file is interrogated by the computer to see which books are 
overdue for return 
• The computer reads a record from the book file and compares the due date with the current date 
• If the date is less than or equal to the current date, the book file is linked to the borrower’s file 
and the corresponding record is read from the borrower’s file 
• A letter or email is automatically sent out  

Expert systems  
• These are systems that are developed to mimic the expertise and knowledge if an expert in a 
particular field 
• Examples include: diagnosing a car engine fault, diagnosing a person’s illness, prospecting for 
oil and minerals, tax and financial calculation, chess games, identification of plants and animals 
as well as road scheduling for delivery vehicles  
Components of an expert system 
• User interface: this is the only thing that the end user sees, allows the user to interact with the 
system and it often requires training to operate effectively  
• Knowledge base: this is a database designed to allow complex storage and retrieval 
requirements of a computerised knowledge-based management system 
• Inference engine: this is software that attempts to derive answers from the knowledge base using 
a form of reasoning  
• Rules base: this is made up of a series of rules which are used by the inference engine to search 
for answers in the knowledge base 
How to set up an expert system  
• Expert in the field are interviewed to find out what is needed in the expert system 
• Data is then collected from experts and other reliable sources 
• A knowledge base is designed and created 
• A rules base is designed and created 
• An inference engine is designed and created 
• The input screen and output format (user interface) is designed and created 
• It is also checked to see if it meets the original specifications 
• Experts are interviewed about how effective the new system is  
Example on an expert system: Oil Prospecting  
• An interactive use screen appears 
• Questions about the geographical profiles are asked (type of soil, rock and minerals found) 
• Answers to the questions and information about the geographical profiles are typed in 
• The inference engine searches the knowledge base using the rules base 
• The system provides the following results: 
i. 
Gives the probability of finding oil 
ii. 
Indicates the depths of the deposit  
iii. 
It makes predictions about the geological profiles above the soil 
iv. 
Produces a map showing concentration of minerals, rocks etc.

• There is need to train workers to use the 
new system 
 

Computers in the Retail Industry 
Automatic Stock Control  
• Barcodes are attached to all items sold in the supermarket 
• Each bar is associated with a stock file which contains details such as prices, stock levels and 
product descriptions 
• The bar code acts as the primary key in the stock file 
• At the POS the product’s barcode is scanned by the barcode reader 
• The barcode is searched for in the stock file, record by record until a match is found 
• The price of the item is read and sent back to the POS together with the product description  
• The stock level for the item is reduced by one 
• The new stock level is written back to the file 
• The new stock level is compared to the re-order level 
• If the new stock level is equal to or lower than the re-order level then the computer automatically 
orders another batch from the supplier 
• Once goods have been ordered a flag is assigned to the items in the file to avoid double re-
ordering until the new items have arrived  
Use of EFTPOS 
• Card inserted into chip and PIN reader 
• Business’ bank contacts customer’s bank 
• Card is checked if it is valid 
• If the card is stolen or expired, then the transaction is terminated 
• Customer enters PIN using keypad 
• PIN is read from chip on card and is compared to one just keyed in 
• If they are the same, the transaction is proceed 
• Check is then made on whether they have enough funds 
• If there are not enough funds available, transaction is terminated, otherwise, transaction is 
authorized 
• Authorization code is sent to the business 
• Amount deducted from customer’s account 
• Same amount of money is credited to the business’ account 
• Receipt is produced

find username and passwords of a user  
• Employee call monitors: allows the employer to listen to the employee’s telephone calls. There 
are 3 ways in which they can be monitored: 
i. 
Monitor: the manager/supervisor can listen to calls without the employee or the 
customer’s awareness 
ii. 
Whisper: the manager can help the employee with the call, but the customer can’t heat 
the manager speak 
iii. 
Barge: both the employee and the customer can hear the manager  
• Employee call monitors: allows the employer to listen to employee’s telephone calls. Call 
monitors can be used:

ict,7. Systems Analysis and Design,"Systems Analysis and Design 
• It is a method used to develop a new system for an organisation 
• There are many stages involved: 1) investigation and analysis, 2) design, 3) development and 
testing, 4) implantation, 5) documentation and 6) evaluation  
1. Investigation and Analysis  
A company would employ a system analyst to perform the following tasks: 
i. 
Research or collect data from the current system 
ii. 
Describe the current system (establish the inputs, outputs and processing being done) 
iii. 
Identify the problems with the current system 
iv. 
Identify and agree with customer requirements 
v. 
Produce a cost-benefit analysis

It is expensive 
 
Data Flow Diagrams 
• The need to identify inputs, outputs and processing of the current system 
• The need to identify problems with the current system 
• The need to identify user and information requirements for the new system 

• System specifications: 
a) Identify and justify suitable hardware for the new system  
b) Identify and justify new software for the new system 
2. Design  
All important components are designed. The following are some of the components that need to be 
designed: 
1) Data capture forms/input forms 
2) Screen layouts 
3) Output formats  
4) System flow charts/pseudo codes 
5) Output forms and reports 
6) Data file structures 
7) Algorithms or program flowcharts 
8) Hardware and software specifications 
9) Test plans 
Data Capture forms  
Properties of a well-designed paper based data capture form 
• Heading that makes the purpose of the form clear 
• Clear indication of where to place answers 
• Use of boxes that both ensures for sufficient information and limits excessive information  
• Makes use of tick boxes 
• Uses clear texts and colours making it easy to read 
Properties of a well-designed computer based data capture form 
• Use of text boxes to capture key data clearly 
• Use of on screen help when completing the form  
• Use of drop down/combo boxes where there are limited choices 
• Automatic validation of data as it is entered 
• Control buttons (next form, clear entry, save etc.) 
• Double entry boxes to check correctness of key data 
Screen displays and printed reports 
Screen outputs should be designed: 
• To make sure the size of all output fields is correct 
• So that any instructions/ descriptions are clear 
• So that the full screen is utilised 
• So that colours and fonts make the output clear 
Verification 
Verification is a way of preventing errors when data is copied from one medium to another. 
• Double entry: in this method when data is entered twice, possibly by two different operators, the 
data is than compared against each other and a warning is given if the data does not match 

• Visual check: this is the checking for errors by the person entering the data, whilst comparing it 
to the original data  
Validation 
Validation is a process where data is checked to see if it satisfies a certain criteria when input into a 
computer, the following are the different types of validation checks used: 
i. 
Range check: checks whether data is within given/ acceptable values 
ii. 
Look-up check: checks whether the data entered exists and is stored in a table of data  
iii. 
Length check: checks if the input data contains the required number of characters 
iv. 
Character/type check: checks that the data does not contain invalid characters 
v. 
Format/picture check: checks that the data is in a specific format 
vi. 
Presence check: checks if the data is actually present and hasn’t been missed out 
vii. 
Consistency check: checks if the fields correspond with each other  
viii. 
Check digit: this is an extra digit calculated from digits of a number and added to the end of a 
number 
File structures 
The fields used in the files need to take the following into account: 
i. 
Field length 
ii. 
Field name 
iii. 
Data type  
3. Development and Testing 
It is essential to test the data to ensure: 
• It meets the agreed client requirements 
• Removes bugs/errors from the system 
• It produces the required output for data where the correct output is already known 
• Checks that the software doesn’t crash under certain conditions  
Development  
• During this phase the software and hardware engineers work together to develop a working 
system, following the designs from the previous design stage 
• Each stage is tested as it is developed 
• Once all the development has taken place the whole system will be tested using the design stage 
• If any test results are not satisfactory then changes will be made and the system tested again 
• The file structure is finalised at this stage and also tested 
• Validation routines and verification methods are used to ensure file structure is designed 
Test Data 
• Once the system is developed it needs to be tested 
• Each module is tested individually and then the whole system is tested 
• Testing will use many different types of data which can be: 
a) Normal test data- this is data which is acceptable or valid, it is also data within the limits of 
acceptability 
b) Extreme test data- this is data at the limits of acceptability/validity  

c) Abnormal test data- this is data outside the limits of acceptability/validity and should be 
rejected or cause an error message to be displayed 
d) Live test data-  this is data from the old/current system  
4. Implementation  
Direct Implementation 
• With this method the old system is stopped overnight and the new system is introduced 
immediately  
Advantages 
i. 
The benefits are immediate  
ii. 
Costs are reduced (since only one system is used there is no need to pay for two sets of staff) 
iii. 
Less likelihood of a malfunction since the new system will have been fully tested 
Disadvantages 
i. 
This method can be disastrous if the new system fails since the old system is no longer 
available 
ii. 
Most difficult to train staff 
Parallel Implementation  
• The old and the new systems are run side by side for a time before the new system takes over 
altogether  
Advantages 
i. 
If the new system fails, the old system is still available  
ii. 
It is possible to gradually train staff 
Disadvantages 
i. 
It is more expensive than direct since extra staff are needed to run both systems altogether 
ii. 
It is more time consuming than direct since data needs to be entered into two systems  
Pilot Implementation 
• The new system is introduced in one part of the company  
• If the system is successful in one part of the company then it will be introduced to all branches 
Advantages 
i. 
If the new system fails only part of the company is affected 
ii. 
Easy to evaluate since both systems are running  
iii. 
It is possible to train staff in one area only, which is much faster and less costly than parallel 
Disadvantages 
i. 
It can be slow to get a pilot to completely replace the whole system 
ii. 
A pilot may not show the problems that a full scale implementation would. This is because a 
system may work well as a small scale but have problems when data is used 
iii. 
It is more expensive than direct implementation since each pilot needs to be evaluated before the 
next stage is introduced 

Phased Implementation 
• Only part of the system is introduced 
• When successful the next part is introduced until the old system is fully replaced 
Advantages 
i. 
Each phase can be evaluated before moving to the next one 
ii. 
A well planned and controlled introduction of the new system 
iii. 
Easy to train staff by letting them learn new skills on each phase as it is introduced 
Disadvantages 
i. 
It is more expensive than direct changeover since it is necessary to evaluate each phase before 
moving to the next stage 
ii. 
Slower than direct changeover  
iii. 
Although each phase can be evaluated you have to wait for all the phases to be completed to 
evaluate the whole changeover

Physical Safety 
Health Aspects 
• Health and safety regulations advise that all computer systems have at least tiltable and anti-
glare screens, adjustable chairs and foot supports, suitable lighting and uncluttered work 
stations, and recommend frequent breaks and frequent eye tests. 
 
Safety Aspects 
Safety Risk  
Ways of eliminating or minimising risk 
Electrocution 
• Use an RCB (residual current breaker) 
• Check insulation on wires regularly  
• Don’t allow drinks near computers 
• Check equipment on a regular basis 
Trailing wires (trip 
hazard) 
 
• Use cable ducts to make the wires safe 
• Cover wires and/or have them tucked away 
• Use wireless connections wherever possible, thus eliminating cables 
Heavy equipment 
falling and 
causing injury 
• Use strong desks and tables to support heavy hardware 
• Use large desks so that hardware isn’t too close to the edge where it can 
fall off 
Fire risk 
 
• Have a carbon dioxide/dry fire extinguisher nearby 
• Don’t cover equipment vents 
• Make sure that the electrics used in the hardware are fully maintained 
• Ensure good ventilation  
• Don’t overload sockets with too many items 
• Change to low voltage hardware wherever possible 
 
Minimising safety risks 
▪ Check the stare of wires/cables/plugs regularly  
▪ Make sure that drinks are kept away from the computer 
▪ Fix wires along walls/desk to avoid direct contact with people 
▪ Don’t cover computers with paper/fabric- prevent ventilation  
▪ Don’t plug too many devices into an electric outlet socket-overloading a socket can cause a fire 
▪ Take regular exercise every hour 
▪ Carry out an ergonomic assessment on your work station  
E-Safety 
▪ Personal data refers to any data concerning a living person who can be either identified from the 
data itself or from the data in conjunction with other information (e.g. name, address, DOB, 
medical history, banking details etc.) 

▪ If personal data is leaked, it may lead to: identity theft, bank fraud, damages to personal 
property, kidnapping 
▪ To prevent the above it is essential that personal data is protected  
▪ If a student shares a photograph of themselves in their school uniform on social media, then 
paedophiles, kidnappers etc. can physically reach the student  
Internet safety  
▪ To keep personal data safe, one must: 
i. 
Not give unknown people personal data or send pictures of themselves to them  
ii. 
Maintain privacy settings to control which cookies are on their computer 
iii. 
Use learner friendly search engines and websites recommended by educational 
institutions 
iv. 
The website being accessed is from a trusted source or has a padlock symbol/ https 
protocol (s for secure) 
Email Safety  
▪ Open emails only from known sources, and do not click on emails with hyperlinks without 
confirming the sender of the email. Think before opening an email from an unknown person, 
never send any other sensitive information  
▪ Ask their ISP to enable email filtering to classify spam mails as spam 
Social Media Safety 
▪ Block and report users who seem suspicious or use inappropriate language 
▪ Never use a real name, only use a nickname 
▪ Use appropriate language  
▪ Do not enter chat rooms, as users can lure you into giving personal information by seeming too 
nice 
▪ Do not meet anyone off the internet for the first time on your own, or at least speak to a trusted 
adult first  
▪ Do not misuse images 
▪ Respect the confidentiality of other uses 
Online Games 
▪ Similar measures apply to that taken when using social media 
▪ Additionally, players should be careful about: 
i. 
In-game violence 
ii. 
Cyber bullying  
iii. 
Keeping their webcams off 
iv. 
Predators may use voice masking technology to lure a user to reveal their age, sex etc. 
v. 
Cyber-attacks involving viruses, ransomware etc. 
 
 
 
 

Security of Data 
Effective security of data 
Hacking  
This is the act of gaining unauthorised access to a computer system 
▪ This can lead to identity theft or the misuse of personal information  
▪ Data can be deleted, changed or corrupted on a user’s  computer  
▪ Use of encryption won’t stop hacking-it makes the data unreadable to the hacker but the data can 
still be deleted, altered or corrupted  
▪ Can be minimised by: 
i. 
Use of firewalls 
ii. 
Use of strong (frequently changed) passwords and user IDs 
iii. 
Use of intrusion detection software 
iv. 
Use of user IDs and passwords 
User IDs 
▪ To log on to a network, a user must type in a user ID 
▪ User ID assigns user privilege once user logs in 
▪ The top level privilege for a network is an administrator: 
Able to set passwords and delete files from server etc. 
▪ User privilege may only allow to access their own work area 
Passwords 
▪ After typing in user ID, the user will be requested to type in their password 
▪ Generally, it is a combination of letters and numbers 
▪ Passwords are shown as stars (***) so nobody overlooking can see it 
▪ Many systems ask for password to be typed in twice as a verification check, in case of input 
errors 
▪ If password is forgotten, administrator must reset it  
▪ If password is forgotten on a website, it will be sent to your e-mail  
Biometric Data 
• Uses features if the human body unique to every individual, such as fingerprints, retina, iris, 
face and voice recognitions. It is used in authentication techniques as it is very 
difficult/impossible to replicate 
Advantages  
Disadvantages 
• Usernames and passwords don’t have to be 
remembered 
• Almost impossible to replicate body parts 
• Somebody else can’t gain access, like with 
a stolen card 
• They can’t be forgotten, like a card 
• The readers are expensive 
• Damages in fingerprints can deny access 
• Some people worry about their personal 
information being stored 
  
 

Security of data online  
Digital Certificate  
▪ A digital certificate is an electronic passport used in the security of data sent over the internet  
▪ They can be attached with mails so that the receiver can know that the mail is from a trusted 
source  
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
▪ Type of protocol that allows data to be sent and received securely over the internet  
▪ When a user logs onto a website, SSL encrypts the data 
▪ https or padlock in the status bar 
▪ When a user wants to access a secure website: 
i. 
User’s web browser sends a message, so it can connect with required website which is 
secured by SSL 
ii. 
Web browser requests that the web server identifies itself 
iii. 
Web server responds by sending a copy its SSL certificate  
iv. 
Web browser checks if certificate is authentic  
v. 
Sends signal back to web browser 
vi. 
Starts to transmit data once connection is established  
vii. 
If not secure, browser will display an open padlock  
Features of a secure webpage  
• The webpage URL is secure, it will start with ‘https’ instead of ‘http’ 
• Padlock sign  
Phishing  
The creator sends out legitimate looking emails to target users. As soon as the recipient clicks on a link 
in the email or attachment, they are sent to a fake website or they are fooled into giving personal data in 
replying to the email. The email often appears to come from a legitimate source. 
▪ The creator of the email can gain personal data, such as bank account data or credit card 
numbers, from the user 
▪ This can lead to fraud or identity theft 
▪ How damage by phishing is minimised: 
i. 
Many ISPs or web browsers filter out phishing emails 
ii. 
Users should always be cautious when opening emails or attachments  
iii. 
Don’t click on attachments that end in –exe., .bat, .com or .php., for example",1280," Health and safety regulations advise that all computer systems have at least tiltable and anti-glare screens, adjustable chairs and foot supports, suitable lighting and uncluttered work stations, and recommend frequent breaks and frequent eye tests .
